   NAME
	AbortPkt -- Aborts an asynchronous packet, if possible. (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	AbortPkt(port, pkt)
		  D1    D2

	void AbortPkt(struct MsgPort *, struct DosPacket *)

   FUNCTION
	This attempts to abort a packet sent earlier with SendPkt to a
	handler.  There is no guarantee that any given handler will allow
	a packet to be aborted, or if it is aborted whether function
	requested completed first or completely.  After calling AbortPkt(),
	you must wait for the packet to return before reusing it or
	deallocating it.

   INPUTS
	port - port the packet was sent to
	pkt  - the packet you wish aborted

   BUGS
	As of V37 to V47, this function does nothing, and it is
	unlikely that it will be ever implemented.

   SEE ALSO
	SendPkt(), DoPkt(), WaitPkt()

dos.library/AddBuffers                                 dos.library/AddBuffers

   NAME
	AddBuffers -- Changes the number of buffers for a filesystem (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AddBuffers(filesystem, number)
	D0		       D1          D2

	BOOL AddBuffers(STRPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Adds buffers to a filesystem.  If it succeeds, the number of current
	buffers is returned in IoErr().  Note that "number" may be negative.
	The amount of memory used per buffer, and any limits on the number of
	buffers, are dependant on the filesystem in question.
	If the call succeeds, the number of buffers in use on the filesystem
	will be returned by IoErr().

   INPUTS
	filesystem - Name of device to add buffers to (with ':').
	number     - Number of buffers to add.  May be negative.

   RESULT
	success    - Success or failure of command.

   BUGS
	The V36 ROM filesystem (FFS/OFS) doesn't return the right number of
	buffers unless preceded by an AddBuffers(fs,-1) (in-use buffers aren't
	counted).  This is fixed in V37.

	The V37 and before ROM filesystem doesn't return success, it returns
	the number of buffers.  The best way to test for this is to consider
	0 (FALSE) failure, -1 (DOSTRUE) to mean that IoErr() will have the
	number of buffers, and any other positive value to be the number of
	buffers.  It may be fixed in some future ROM revision.

   SEE ALSO
	IoErr()

dos.library/AddDosEntry                               dos.library/AddDosEntry

   NAME
	AddDosEntry -- Add a Dos List entry to the lists (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AddDosEntry(dlist)
	D0                     D1

	LONG AddDosEntry(struct DosList *)

   FUNCTION
	Adds a device, volume or assign to the dos devicelist.  Can fail if it 
	conflicts with an existing entry (such as another assign to the same
	name or another device of the same name).  Volume nodes with different
	dates and the same name CAN be added, or with names that conflict with
	devices or assigns.  Note: the dos list does NOT have to be locked to
	call this.  Do not access dlist after adding unless you have locked the
	Dos Device list.

	An additional note concerning calling this from within a handler:
	in order to avoid deadlocks, your handler must either be multi-
	threaded, or it must attempt to lock the list before calling this
	function.  The code would look something like this:

	if (AttemptLockDosList(LDF_xxx|LDF_WRITE))
	{
		rc = AddDosEntry(...);
		UnLockDosList(LDF_xxx|LDF_WRITE);
	}

	If AttemptLockDosList() fails (i.e. it's locked already), check for
	messages at your filesystem port (don't wait!) and try the
	AttemptLockDosList() again.

   INPUTS
	dlist   - Device list entry to be added.

   RESULT
	success - Success/Failure indicator

   SEE ALSO
	RemDosEntry(), FindDosEntry(), NextDosEntry(), LockDosList(),
	MakeDosEntry(), FreeDosEntry(), AttemptLockDosList()

dos.library/AddPart                                       dos.library/AddPart

   NAME
	AddPart -- Appends a file/dir to the end of a path (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AddPart( dirname, filename, size )
	D0                   D1        D2      D3

	BOOL AddPart( STRPTR, STRPTR, ULONG )

   FUNCTION
	This function adds a file, directory, or subpath name to a directory
	path name taking into account any required separator characters.  If
	filename is a fully-qualified path it will totally replace the current
	value of dirname.

   INPUTS
	dirname  - the path to add a file/directory name to.
	filename - the filename or directory name to add.  May be a relative
		   pathname from the current directory (example: foo/bar).
		   Can deal with leading '/'(s), indicating one directory up
		   per '/', or with a ':', indicating it's relative to the
		   root of the appropriate volume.
	size     - size in bytes of the space allocated for dirname.  Must
		   not be 0.

   RESULT
	success - non-zero for ok, FALSE if the buffer would have overflowed.
		  If an overflow would have occured, dirname will not be
		  changed.

   BUGS
	Doesn't check if a subpath is legal (i.e. doesn't check for ':'s) and
	doesn't handle leading '/'s in 2.0 through 2.02 (V36).  V37 fixes
	this, allowing filename to be any path, including absolute.

	Filepart(), PathPart()

dos.library/AddSegment                                 dos.library/AddSegment

   NAME
	AddSegment - Adds a resident segment to the resident list (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AddSegment(name, seglist, type)
	D0		      D1     D2      D3

	BOOL AddSegment(STRPTR, BPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Adds a segment to the Dos resident list, with the specified Seglist
	and type (stored in seg_UC - normally 0).  NOTE: currently unused
	types may cause it to interpret other registers (d4-?) as additional
	parameters in the future.

	Do NOT build Segment structures yourself!

   INPUTS
	name    - name for the segment
	seglist - Dos seglist of code for segment
	type    - initial usecount, normally 0

   RESULT
	success - success or failure

   SEE ALSO
	FindSegment(), RemSegment(), LoadSeg()

dos.library/AllocDosObject                         dos.library/AllocDosObject

   NAME
	AllocDosObject -- Creates a dos object (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	ptr = AllocDosObject(type, tags)
	D0                    D1    D2

	void *AllocDosObject(ULONG, struct TagItem *)

	ptr = AllocDosObjectTagList(type, tags)
	D0                 	     D1    D2

	void *AllocDosObjectTagList(ULONG, struct TagItem *)

	ptr = AllocDosObjectTags(type, Tag1, ...)

	void *AllocDosObjectTags(ULONG, ULONG, ...)

   FUNCTION
	Create one of several dos objects, initializes it, and returns it
	to you.  Note the DOS_STDPKT returns a pointer to the sp_Pkt of the
	structure.

	This function may be called by a task for all types and tags defined
	in the V37 includes. As V47, the following dos objects can be
	created, see <dos/dos.h>:

	DOS_FILEHANDLE	 a struct FileHandle, see <dos/dosextens.h>.
			 Only few people should require this. Note that
			 the dos.library uses a a somewhat larger internal
			 structure that is intentially not documented.
	DOS_EXALLCONTROL a struct ExAllControl that is used for ExAll,
			 see <dos/exall.h>. You MUST use this call to
			 allocate this structure.
	DOS_FIB		 a struct FileInfoBlock, see <dos/dos.h>.
	DOS_STDPKT	 a struct StandardPacket, see <dos/dosextens.h>
	DOS_CLI		 a struct CommandLineInterface, see also
			 <dos/dosextens.h>. Note that the shell uses
			 internally a somewhat larger structure, and
			 only shells equipped with this larger structure
			 will be able to handle DoShellMethod().
			 You must use AllocDosObject() to create a valid
			 CLI structure, creating this structure yourself
			 is no longer acceptable.
	DOS_RDARGS	 A struct RDArgs, see <dos/rdargs.h>

   INPUTS
	type - type of object requested
	tags - pointer to taglist with additional information

   RESULT
	packet - pointer to the object or NULL

   BUGS
	Before V39, DOS_CLI should be used with care since FreeDosObject()
	can't free it.

   SEE ALSO
	FreeDosObject(), <dos/dostags.h>, <dos/dos.h>

dos.library/AssignAdd                                   dos.library/AssignAdd

   NAME
	AssignAdd -- Adds a lock to an assign for multi-directory assigns (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AssignAdd(name,lock)
	D0                   D1   D2

	BOOL AssignAdd(STRPTR,BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Adds a lock to an assign, making or adding to a multi-directory
	assign.  Note that this only will succeed on an assign created with
	AssignLock(), or an assign created with AssignLate() which has been
	resolved (converted into a AssignLock()-assign).

	NOTE: you should not use the lock in any way after making this call
	successfully.  It becomes the part of the assign, and will be unlocked
	by the system when the assign is removed.  If you need to keep the
	lock, pass a lock from DupLock() to AssignLock().

   INPUTS
	name - Name of device to assign lock to (without trailing ':')
	lock - Lock associated with the assigned name

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator.  On failure, the lock is not
		  unlocked.

   SEE ALSO
	Lock(), AssignLock(), AssignPath(), AssignLate(), DupLock(),
	RemAssignList()

dos.library/AssignLate                                 dos.library/AssignLate

   NAME
	AssignLate -- Creates an assignment to a specified path later (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AssignLate(name,path)
	D0                    D1   D2

	BOOL AssignLate(STRPTR,STRPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Sets up a assignment that is expanded upon the FIRST reference to the
	name.  The path (a string) would be attached to the node.  When
	the name is referenced (Open("FOO:xyzzy"...), the string will be used
	to determine where to set the assign to, and if the directory can be
	locked, the assign will act from that point on as if it had been
	created by AssignLock().

	A major advantage is assigning things to unmounted volumes, which
	will be requested upon access (useful in startup sequences).

   INPUTS
	name - Name of device to be assigned (without trailing ':')
	path - Name of late assignment to be resolved on the first reference.

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator of the operation

   SEE ALSO
	Lock(), AssignAdd(), AssignPath(), AssignLock(),

dos.library/AssignLock                                 dos.library/AssignLock

   NAME
	AssignLock -- Creates an assignment to a locked object (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AssignLock(name,lock)
	D0                    D1   D2

	BOOL AssignLock(STRPTR,BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Sets up an assign of a name to a given lock.  Passing NULL for a lock 
	cancels any outstanding assign to that name.  If an assign entry of
	that name is already on the list, this routine replaces that entry.  If
	an entry is on the list that conflicts with the new assign, then a
	failure code is returned.

	NOTE: you should not use the lock in any way after making this call
	successfully.  It becomes the assign, and will be unlocked by the
	system when the assign is removed.  If you need to keep the lock,
	pass a lock from DupLock() to AssignLock().

   INPUTS
	name - Name of device to assign lock to (without trailing ':')
	lock - Lock associated with the assigned name

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator.  On failure, the lock is not
		  unlocked.

dos.library/AssignPath                                 dos.library/AssignPath

   NAME
	AssignPath -- Creates an assignment to a specified path (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = AssignPath(name,path)
	D0                    D1   D2

	BOOL AssignPath(STRPTR,STRPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Sets up a assignment that is expanded upon EACH reference to the name.
	This is implemented through a new device list type (DLT_ASSIGNPATH, or
	some such).  The path (a string) would be attached to the node.  When
	the name is referenced (Open("FOO:xyzzy"...), the string will be used
	to determine where to do the open.  No permanent lock will be part of
	it.  For example, you could AssignPath() c2: to df2:c, and references
	to c2: would go to df2:c, even if you change disks.

	The other major advantage is assigning things to unmounted volumes,
	which will be requested upon access (useful in startup sequences).

   INPUTS
	name - Name of device to be assigned (without trailing ':')
	path - Name of late assignment to be resolved at each reference

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator of the operation

   SEE ALSO
	AssignAdd(), AssignLock(), AssignLate(), Open()

dos.library/AttemptLockDosList                 dos.library/AttemptLockDosList

   NAME
	AttemptLockDosList -- Attempt to lock the Dos Lists for use (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	dlist = AttemptLockDosList(flags)
	D0			    D1

	struct DosList *AttemptLockDosList(ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	Locks the dos device list in preparation to walk the list.  If the
	list is 'busy' then this routine will return NULL.  See LockDosList()
	for more information.

   INPUTS
	flags - Flags stating which types of nodes you want to lock.

   RESULT
	dlist - Pointer to the beginning of the list or NULL.  Not a valid
		node!

   BUGS
	In V36 through V39.23 dos, this would return NULL or 0x00000001 for
	failure.  Fixed in V39.24 dos (after kickstart 39.106).

dos.library/ChangeMode                                 dos.library/ChangeMode

   NAME
	ChangeMode - Change the current mode of a lock or filehandle (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = ChangeMode(type, object, newmode)
	D0                    D1     D2      D3

	BOOL ChangeMode(ULONG, BPTR, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	This allows you to attempt to change the mode in use by a lock or
	filehandle.  For example, you could attempt to turn a shared lock
	into an exclusive lock.  The handler may well reject this request.
	Warning: if you use the wrong type for the object, the system may
	crash.

   INPUTS
	type    - Either CHANGE_FH or CHANGE_LOCK
	object  - A lock or filehandle
	newmode - The new mode you want

   RESULT
	success - Boolean

   BUGS
	Did not work in 2.02 or before (V36).  Works in V37.  In the
	earlier versions, it can crash the machine.

	Will crash in V36-V47.23 if type == CHANGE_FH and the object is
	a file handle opened on "NIL:". Works in V47.24.

   NAME
	CheckSignal -- Checks for break signals (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	signals = CheckSignal(mask)
	D0		      D1

	ULONG CheckSignal(ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	This function checks to see if any signals specified in the mask have
	been set and if so, returns them.  Otherwise it returns FALSE.
	All signals specified in mask will be cleared.

   INPUTS
	mask    - Signals to check for.

   RESULT
	signals - Signals specified in mask that were set.

   NAME
	Cli -- Returns a pointer to the CLI structure of the process (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	cli_ptr = Cli()
	D0

	struct CommandLineInterface *Cli(void)

   FUNCTION
	Returns a pointer to the CLI structure of the current process, or NULL
	if the process has no CLI structure.

   RESULT
	cli_ptr - pointer to the CLI structure, or NULL.

   NOTES
	Manipulating or reading fields from the struct CommandLineInterface
	structure is discouraged, use the appropriate interface functions.
	Also, the shell may have additional parameters or functions that
	are not accessible through this structure, but only through
	DoShellMethod().

   NAME
	CliInitNewcli -- Set up a process to be a shell from initial packet
	OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE

   SYNOPSIS
	OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE
	flags = CliInitNewcli( packet )
	D0		         A0

	LONG CliInitNewcli( struct DosPacket * )
	OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE OBSOLETE

   FUNCTION
	As of V47, this function does nothing and just runs into an
	Alert(). NewShell or NewCLI no longer go through this function,
	but instead sends a startup packet to the shell that will request
	the shell to get initialized through CliInitRun() instead in all
	cases. A shell will thus never need to call this function as using
	it is never requested by the operating system.

   INPUTS
	packet - the initial packet sent to your process MsgPort

   RESULT
	fn - flags or a pointer

   SEE ALSO
	CliInitRun(), ReplyPkt(), WaitPkt(), IoErr()

dos.library/CliInitRun                                 dos.library/CliInitRun

   NAME
	CliInitRun -- Set up a process to be a shell from initial packet

   SYNOPSIS
	flags = CliInitRun( packet )
	D0		      A0

	LONG CliInitRun( struct DosPacket * )

   FUNCTION
	This function initializes a process and CLI structure for a new
	shell, from parameters in an initial packet passed by the system
	(Run, System(), Execute()). As of V47, also the initial CLI and
	a shell created through NewCLI is initialized through this vector,
	and all other forms of shell initialization are obsolete and not
	requested by the Os anymore.
	The format of the data in the packet is purposely not defined.
	The setup includes all the normal fields in the structures that
	are required for proper operation (current directory, paths,
	input streams, etc).

	It returns a set of flags containing information about what type
	of shell invocation this is.

	Definitions for the values of fn:
		Bit 31     Set to indicate flags are valid
		Bit  3     Set to indicate asynch system call
		Bit  2     Set if this is a System() call
		Bit  1     Set if user provided input stream
		Bit  0     Set if RUN provided output stream

	If Bit 31 is 0, then you must check IoErr() to determine if an error
	occurred.  If IoErr() returns a pointer to your process, there has
	been an error, and you should clean up and exit.  The packet will
	have already been returned by CliInitRun().  If it isn't a pointer
	to your process and Bit 31 is 0, you should wait before replying
	the packet until after you've loaded the first command (or when you
	exit).  This helps avoid disk "gronking" with the Run command.

	If Bit 31 is 1, then if Bit 3 is one, ReplyPkt() the packet
	immediately (Asynch System()), otherwise wait until your shell exits
	(Sync System(), Execute()).
	
   INPUTS
	packet - the initial packet sent to your process MsgPort

    NAME
	Close -- Close an open file

    SYNOPSIS
	success = Close( file )
	   D0             D1

	BOOL Close(BPTR)

    FUNCTION
	The file specified by the file handle is closed. You must close all
	files you explicitly opened, but you must not close inherited file
	handles that are passed to you (each filehandle must be closed once
	and ONLY once).  If Close() fails, the file handle is still
	deallocated and should not be used.

    INPUTS
	file - BCPL pointer to a file handle

    RESULTS
	success - returns if Close() succeeded.  Note that it might fail
		  depending on buffering and whatever IO must be done to
		  close a file being written to.  NOTE: this return value
		  did not exist before V36!
	In case of success, Close() restores the value of IoErr() to the
	value it had before the call. IoErr() is only touched in case of
	failure.

    NOTES
	Starting from V47 onwards, Close(0) does nothing and returns
	immediately.

   NAME
	CreateNewProc -- Create a new process (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	process = CreateNewProc(tags)
	D0                       D1

	struct Process *CreateNewProc(struct TagItem *)

	process = CreateNewProcTagList(tags)
	D0                       	D1

	struct Process *CreateNewProcTagList(struct TagItem *)

	process = CreateNewProcTags(Tag1, ...)

	struct Process *CreateNewProcTags(ULONG, ...)

   FUNCTION
	This creates a new process according to the tags passed in.  See
	dos/dostags.h for the tags.

	You must specify one of NP_Seglist or NP_Entry.  NP_Seglist takes a
	seglist (as returned by LoadSeg()).  NP_Entry takes a function
	pointer for the routine to call.

	There are many options, as you can see by examining dos/dostags.h.
	The defaults are for a non-CLI process, with copies of your
	CurrentDir, HomeDir (used for PROGDIR:), priority, consoletask,
	windowptr, and variables.  The input and output filehandles default
	to opens of NIL:, stack to 4000, and others as shown in dostags.h.
	This is a fairly reasonable default setting for creating threads,
	though you may wish to modify it (for example, to give a descriptive
	name to the process.)

	CreateNewProc() is callable from a task, though any actions that
	require doing Dos I/O (DupLock() of currentdir, for example) will not
	occur.

	NOTE: if you call CreateNewProc() with both NP_Arguments, you must
	not specify an NP_Input of NULL.  When NP_Arguments is specified, it
	needs to modify the input filehandle to make ReadArgs() work properly.

   INPUTS
	tags - a pointer to a TagItem array. The following tags are supported
	as of V47, see also <dos/dostags.h>:

	NP_Seglist	(BPTR)	Seglist of the code to run
	NP_FreeSeglist	(BOOL)	A flag that indicates whether the seglist
			provided by NP_Seglist is to be released on exit.
			Default is FALSE.
	NP_Entry	(APTR)	Entry point of the code to run, mutually
			exclusive to NP_Seglist. Do NOT specify NP_FreeSegList
			with this tag.
	NP_Input	(BPTR)	Filehandle to use as pr_CIS, default is
			Open("NIL:",MODE_OLDFILE).
	NP_Output	(BPTR)	Filehandle to use as pr_COS, default is
			Open("NIL:",MODE_NEWFILE).
	NP_CloseInput	(BOOL)	Close pr_CIS on exit. Default is TRUE. Make
			sure not to reset this tag if you do not specify
			NP_Input.
	NP_CloseOutput	(BOOL)	Close pr_COS on exit. Default is TRUE. Make
			sure not to reset this tag if you do not specify
			NP_Output.
	NP_Error	(BPTR)	Filehandle to use as pr_CES, default is 0,
			i.e. error output will be redirected to pr_COS.
	NP_CloseError	(BOOL)	Close pr_CES on exit. Default is FALSE.
	NP_CurrentDir	(BPTR)	Lock to use as current directory. Default
			is DupLock() of the current directory of the caller,
			or 0 if the caller is a task, not a process.
	NP_StackSize	(ULONG)	Stack size for the process. Defaults to
			4000 bytes.
	NP_Name		(const UBYTE *) Name for the new process. Default
			is "New Process".
	NP_Priority	(BYTE) Priority of the new process. Default is the
			same as the parent.
	NP_ConsoleTask	(struct MsgPort *) Message port of the process
			handling "*" and "CONSOLE:". Default is the same
			as the caller, or NULL if the caller is a task.
	NP_WindowPtr	(struct Window *) Pointer to the window in which
			context error requesters will be displayed.
			Default is the same as the caller, or NULL if the
			caller is a task.
	NP_HomeDir	(BPTR) Lock to the home directory of the process,
			used to resolve PROGDIR:, default is DupLock() of
			home directory of the caller, or 0 of the caller
			is a task.
	NP_CopyVars	(BOOL) Copy local shell variables if they exist.
			Default is TRUE.
	NP_Cli		(BOOL) Create a struct CommandLineInterface and
			attach it to the caller. Default is FALSE.
	NP_Path		(BPTR) Singly BPTR-linked list of locks to be used
			for searching for commands. Only used if NP_Cli is
			set. Default is to copy the path of the caller, if
			it exists.
	NP_CommandName	(const UBYTE *) Pointer to a string of at most
			104 characters, to be used as command name of the
			shell to be created. Used only if NP_Cli is set.
			Default is the command name of the caller. Note
			that the input string is a NUL-terminated C style
			string, not a BSTR.
	NP_Arguments	(const UBYTE *) Pointer to command line arguments,
			passed into the process created, both through the
			registers a0 (pointer) and d0 (length) as well as
			in the buffer of pr_CIS, which therefore shall
			exist, either by default (NP_Input unspecified) or
			by a non-zero value of NP_Input. The arguments are
			copied before they are passed in, and the copy is
			released on exit. Default is not to setup any
			arguments and to keep the buffer of pr_CIS
			untouched.
	NP_ExitCode	Code to be called when process dies down, receives
			the return code in d0, and NP_ExitData in d1.
	NP_ExitData	Data to be forwarded to NP_ExitCode in register d1.

   RESULT
	process - The created process, or NULL.  Note that if it returns
		  NULL, you must free any items that were passed in via
		  tags, such as if you passed in a new current directory
		  with NP_CurrentDir.

   BUGS
	In V36, NP_Arguments was broken in a number of ways, and probably
	should be avoided (instead you should start a small piece of your
	own code, which calls RunCommand() to run the actual code you wish
	to run).  In V37, NP_Arguments works, though see the note above.

	NP_FreeSeglist was erraneously documented to have the default TRUE,
	but the default was always FALSE.

	NP_Error was documented in V40, but was disfuntional until V47.
	It is supported in V47.

	NP_CloseError was documented to have the default TRUE, but pr_CES
	was never closed, nor populated (see above). In fact, the tag
	was ignored completely. To avoid problems, the default for
	NP_CloseError is FALSE in V47.

	NP_CurrentDir, NP_HomeDir and NP_Path copy by default the
	corresponding fields of the caller, by DupLock() or by a series
	of DupLocks(). While this was always true, the include file
	<dos/dostags.h> may have suggested that the lock(s) were
	used for the new process without creating copies.

	NP_Synchronous and NP_NotifyOnDeath were never implemented,
	even though they are documented. Do not use, and do not expect to
	work.

    NAME

	CreateProc -- Create a new process

    SYNOPSIS
	process = CreateProc( name, pri, seglist, stackSize )
	D0		      D1    D2	 D3	  D4

	struct MsgPort *CreateProc(STRPTR, LONG, BPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	CreateProc() creates a new AmigaDOS process of name 'name'.  AmigaDOS
	processes are a superset of exec tasks.

	A seglist, as returned by LoadSeg(), is passed as 'seglist'.
	This represents a section of code which is to be run as a new
	process. The code is entered at the first hunk in the segment list,
	which should contain suitable initialization code or a jump to
	such.  A process control structure is allocated from memory and
	initialized.  If you wish to fake a seglist (that will never
	have DOS UnLoadSeg() called on it), use this code:

		    DS.L    0	;Align to longword
		    DC.L    16	;Segment "length" (faked)
		    DC.L    0	;Pointer to next segment
		    ...start of code...

	The size of the root stack upon activation is passed as
	'stackSize'.  'pri' specifies the required priority of the new
	process.  The result will be the process msgport address of the new
	process, or zero if the routine failed.  The argument 'name'
	specifies the new process name.  A zero return code indicates
	error.

	The seglist passed to CreateProc() is not freed when it exits; it
	is up to the parent process to free it, or for the code to unload
	itself.

	Under V36 and later, you probably should use CreateNewProc() instead.

    INPUTS
	name      - pointer to a null-terminated string
	pri       - signed long (range -128 to +127)
	seglist   - BCPL pointer to a seglist
	stackSize - integer (must be a multiple of 4 bytes)

    RESULTS
	process   - pointer to new process msgport

    NAME
	CurrentDir -- Make a directory lock the current directory

    SYNOPSIS
	oldLock = CurrentDir( lock )
	D0		      D1

	BPTR CurrentDir(BPTR)

    FUNCTION
	CurrentDir() causes a directory associated with a lock to be made
	the current directory.	The old current directory lock is returned.

	A value of zero is a valid result here, this 0 lock represents the
	root of file system that you booted from.

	Any call that has to Open() or Lock() files (etc) requires that
	the current directory be a valid lock or 0.

    INPUTS
	lock - BCPL pointer to a lock

dos.library/DateStamp                                   dos.library/DateStamp

    NAME
	DateStamp -- Obtain the date and time in internal format

    SYNOPSIS
	ds = DateStamp( ds );
	D0		D1

	struct DateStamp *DateStamp(struct DateStamp *)

    FUNCTION
	DateStamp() takes a structure of the same name and fills it in:

	   struct DateStamp {
	      LONG ds_Days;
	      LONG ds_Minute;
	      LONG ds_Tick;
	   };

	The first element is a count of the number of days since January 1, 1978.
	The second element is the number of minutes elapsed in the day, past
	midnight. The third is the number of ticks elapsed in the current minute.

	A tick happens 50 times a second. Note that the number of ticks per
	second is a preset constant and not in any way affected by the display
	refresh rate (vertical blanking frequency) or the AC power supply
	frequency.

	DateStamp() ensures that the day and minute are consistent. All three
	elements are zero if the date is unset.

    INPUTS
	ds - pointer a struct DateStamp

    RESULTS
	The DateStamp structure is filled as described and its address is
	returned (for pre-V36 compatibility).

    NOTES
	Prior to V36 DateStamp() would only return even multiples of 50 ticks.
	Therefore the time you got was always an even number of ticks. This
	is no longer the case with V36 and beyond.

   NAME
	DateToStr -- Converts a DateStamp to a string (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = DateToStr( datetime )
	D0                      D1

	BOOL DateToStr(struct DateTime *)

   FUNCTION
	StamptoStr converts an AmigaDOS DateStamp to a human
	readable text string as requested by your settings in the
	DateTime structure.

   INPUTS
	DateTime - a pointer to an initialized DateTime structure.

	The DateTime structure should be initialized as follows:

	dat_Stamp - a copy of the DateStamp you wish to convert to
		  a text string.

	dat_Format - a format byte which specifies the format of the
		  dat_StrDate. This can be any of the following
		  (Note: If the value used is something other than those
		  below, the default of FORMAT_DOS will be used):

		  FORMAT_DOS:	  AmigaDOS format (dd-mmm-yy).

		  FORMAT_INT:	  International format (yy-mmm-dd).

		  FORMAT_USA:	  American format (mm-dd-yy).

		  FORMAT_CDN:	  Canadian format (dd-mm-yy).

		  FORMAT_DEF:	  default format for locale.

	dat_Flags - a flags byte.  The only flag which affects this
		  function is:

		  DTF_SUBST:	  If set, a string such as Today,
				  Monday, etc., will be used instead
				  of the dat_Format specification if
				  possible.

		  DTF_FUTURE:	  Ignored by this function.

	dat_StrDay - pointer to a buffer to receive the day of the
		  week string (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). If NULL, this
		  string will not be generated. See NOTES below for
		  minimum size of the string buffer.

	dat_StrDate - pointer to a buffer to receive the date
		  string, in the format requested by dat_Format,
		  subject to possible modifications by DTF_SUBST.
		  If NULL, this string will not be generated.
		  See NOTES below for minimum size of the string
		  buffer.

	dat_StrTime - pointer to a buffer to receive the time of day
		  string. If NULL, this string will not be generated.
		  See NOTES below for minimum size of the string
		  buffer.

   RESULT
	success - a zero return indicates that the DateStamp was
		  invalid, and could not be converted. Non-zero
		  indicates that the call succeeded.

   NOTES
	The string buffers pointed to by the dat_StrDay, dat_StrDate and
	dat_StrTime members must be at least LEN_DATSTRING bytes in size
	(including the terminating NUL byte).

	The dat_Format FORMAT_DEF option will only be supported if the
	locale.library is currently active. Otherwise, FORMAT_DOS will
	be used instead.

    NAME
	Delay -- Delay a process for a specified time

    SYNOPSIS

    FUNCTION
	The argument 'ticks' specifies how many ticks (50 per second) to

    BUGS
	Due to a bug in the timer.device in V1.2/V1.3, specifying a timeout
	of zero for Delay() can cause the unreliable timer & floppy disk
	operation.  This is fixed in V36 and later.

		 defined flags include:

		 GVF_LOCAL_ONLY  - delete a local (to your process) variable.
		 GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY - delete a global environment variable.

		 The default is to delete a local variable if found, otherwise
		 a global environment variable if found (only for LV_VAR).

   RESULT

    SYNOPSIS
	process = DeviceProc( name )
	D0		      D1

	struct MsgPort *DeviceProc (STRPTR)

    FUNCTION
	DeviceProc() returns the process identifier of the process which
	handles the device associated with the specified name. If no
	process handler can be found then the result is zero. If the name
	refers to an assign then a directory lock is returned in IoErr().
	This lock should not be UnLock()ed or Examine()ed (if you wish to do
	so, DupLock() it first).

    BUGS
	In V36, if you try to DeviceProc() something relative to an assign
	made with AssignPath(), it will fail.  This is because there's no
	way to know when to unlock the lock.  If you're writing code for
	V36 or later, it is highly advised you use GetDeviceProc() instead,
	or make your code conditional on V36 to use GetDeviceProc()/
	FreeDeviceProc().

   SYNOPSIS
	result1 = DoPkt(port,action,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5)
	D0               D1    D2    D3   D4   D5   D6   D7

	LONG DoPkt(struct MsgPort *,LONG,LONG,LONG,LONG,LONG,LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Sends a packet to a handler and waits for it to return.  Any secondary
	return will be available in D1 AND from IoErr().  DoPkt() will work
	even if the caller is an exec task and not a process; however it will
	be slower, and may fail for some additional reasons, such as being
	unable to allocate a signal.  DoPkt() uses your pr_MsgPort for the
	reply, and will call pr_PktWait.  (See BUGS regarding tasks, though).

	Only allows 5 arguments to be specified.  For more arguments (packets
	support a maximum of 7) create a packet and use SendPkt()/WaitPkt().

   INPUTS
	port    - pr_MsgPort of the handler process to send to.
	action  - the action requested of the filesystem/handler
	arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4,arg5 - arguments, depend on the action, may not
		   be required.

   RESULT
	result1 - the value returned in dp_Res1, or FALSE if there was some
		  problem in sending the packet or recieving it.
	result2 - Available from IoErr() AND in register D1.

   BUGS
	Using DoPkt() from tasks doesn't work in V36. Use AllocDosObject(),
	PutMsg(), and WaitPort()/GetMsg() for a workaround, or you can call
	CreateNewProc() to start a process to do Dos I/O for you.  In V37,
	DoPkt() will allocate, use, and free the MsgPort required.

   NOTES
	Callable from a task (under V37 and above).
	The prototypes in <clib/dos_protos.h> also define the functions
	DoPkt1() through DoPkt5() which supply only the indicated
	number of arguments. This allows somewhat more compact programs.

   SYNOPSIS
	ptr = DoShellMethodTagList(method, tags)
	D0                           D0     A0

	APTR DoShellMethodTagList(ULONG, struct TagItem *)

	ptr = DoShellMethod(method, Tag1, ...)

	APTR DoShellMethod(ULONG, ULONG, ...)

   FUNCTION
	Request and run a function of a V47 extended shell. The method ID
	specifies which feature of the shell is to be run, the tags
	provide arguments to the method. The return code is either a
	pointer, or an integer casted to a pointer.
	If the current process is not run from a shell, or the shell is
	not extended, the function returns NULL and
	ERROR_OBJECT_WRONG_TYPE in IoErr().

	The following methods are implemented by the V47 ROM shell, see
	also <dos/shell.h>:

	SHELL_METH_METHODS:	Returns a pointer to a 0L terminated list
	of ULONGs that lists all methods the shell supports.

	SHELL_METH_GETHIST:	Return a pointer to the command history.
	The result code is a pointer to a struct MinList whose nodes are
	of type struct HistoryNode, see <dos/shell.h>. This method does
	not take any arguments.

	SHELL_METH_CLRHIST:	Erase the current history. This method
	does not take any arguments. Returns a boolean success indicator.

	SHELL_METH_ADDHIST:	Adds a line to the history. The line
	to be added is provided by the tag SHELL_ADDH_LINE as a NUL-
	terminated C style string. A terminating '\n' is NOT required.
	Returns a boolean success indicator.

	SHELL_METH_FGETS:	Request input from the console, allowing
	TAB expansion of the arguments. This method returns a pointer to
	a NUL terminated C string. The memory of the string is handled
	by the shell and MUST NOT be released by the caller. It is valid
	until the next DoShellMethod() function or until the application
	terminates.
	The following tags are accepted: SHELL_FGETS_FULL is a boolean
	tag that is set to TRUE if the requested line is a full command
	line, and the first argument is a command. The shell will scan
	the full command line search path for its expansion, and may
	print the regular prompt. If FALSE, only files in the current
	directory are scanned, and an abbreviated prompt is printed.
	This tag defaults to FALSE.
	

   INPUTS
	method - method requested from the shell
	tags   - pointer to taglist with additional information

   RESULT
	ptr - result or NULL.

   NOTES
	SHELL_FGETS_FULL is used by ReadArgs() if more parameters
	are required from the caller. If a custom shell supports
	TAB expansion, it is recommended that such a shell also
	implements the above method.

   NAME
	ErrorReport -- Displays a Retry/Cancel requester for an error (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	status = ErrorReport(code, type, arg1, device)
	D0                    D1    D2    D3     D4

	BOOL ErrorReport(LONG, LONG, ULONG, struct MsgPort *)

   FUNCTION
	Based on the request type, this routine formats the appropriate
	requester to be displayed.  If the code is not understood, it returns
	DOS_TRUE immediately.  Returns DOS_TRUE if the user selects CANCEL or
	if the attempt to put up the requester fails, or if the process
	pr_WindowPtr is -1.  Returns FALSE if the user selects Retry.  The
	routine will retry on DISKINSERTED for appropriate error codes.
	These return values are the opposite of what AutoRequest returns.

	This routine is supposed to set IoErr() to code before returning.
	See the BUGS section for limitations and workarounds.

   INPUTS
	code   - Error code to put a requester up for.
	   Current valid error codes are:
		ERROR_DISK_NOT_VALIDATED
		ERROR_DISK_WRITE_PROTECTED
		ERROR_DISK_FULL
		ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED
		ERROR_NOT_A_DOS_DISK
		ERROR_NO_DISK
		ABORT_DISK_ERROR	/* read/write error */
		ABORT_BUSY		/* you MUST replace... */
	type   - Request type:
			REPORT_LOCK   - arg1 is a lock (BPTR).
			REPORT_FH     - arg1 is a filehandle (BPTR).
			REPORT_VOLUME - arg1 is a volumenode (C pointer).
			REPORT_INSERT - arg1 is the string for the volumename
					(will be split on a ':').
					With ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED puts
					up the "Please insert..." requester.
	arg1   - variable parameter (see type)
	device - (Optional) Address of handler task for which report is to be 
	         made.  Only required for REPORT_LOCK, and only if arg1==NULL.

   RESULT
	status - Cancel/Retry indicator (0 means Retry)

   BUGS
	ErrorReport() is supposed to set IoErr() to code before returning.
	In V36-V47.26 it would only set IoErr() to code for the error
	codes listed in the INPUTS section. For all other codes the
	IoErr() status prior to calling ErrorReport() would persist.

	If you need to be sure that the IoErr() return value matches the
	error code you pass to ErrorReport() in case the status returned
	is not 0 (0 means Retry), call SetIoErr(code) prior to calling
	ErrorReport().

   NOTES
	ErrorReport() cannot be called from a Task because it assumes
	that is getting called from a Process.

   NAME
	ExAll -- Examine an entire directory (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	continue = ExAll(lock, buffer, size, type, control)
	D0               D1     D2     D3    D4     D5

	BOOL ExAll(BPTR,STRPTR,LONG,LONG,struct ExAllControl *)

   FUNCTION
	Examines an entire directory.  

 Lock must be on a directory.  Size is the size of the buffer supplied.
 The buffer will be filled with (partial) ExAllData structures, as
 specified by the type field.

 Type is a value from those shown below that determines which information is
 to be stored in the buffer.  Each higher value adds a new thing to the list
 as described in the table below:-

	ED_NAME		FileName
	ED_TYPE		Type
	ED_SIZE		Size in bytes
	ED_PROTECTION	Protection bits
	ED_DATE		3 longwords of date
	ED_COMMENT	Comment (will be NULL if no comment)
	ED_OWNER	owner user-id and group-id (if supported)  (V39)

 Thus, ED_NAME gives only filenames, and ED_OWNER gives everything.

 NOTE: V37 dos.library, when doing ExAll() emulation, and V37 filesystems
 will return an error if passed ED_OWNER.  If you get ERROR_BAD_NUMBER,
 retry with ED_COMMENT to get everything but owner info.  All filesystems
 supporting ExAll() must support through ED_COMMENT, and must check Type
 and return ERROR_BAD_NUMBER if they don't support the type.

 The ead_Next entry gives a pointer to the next entry in the buffer.  The
 last entry will have NULL in ead_Next.

 The control structure is required so that FFS can keep track if more than
 one call to ExAll is required.  This happens when there are more names in
 a directory than will fit into the buffer.  The format of the control
 structure is as follows:-

 NOTE: the control structure MUST be allocated by AllocDosObject!!!

 Entries:  This field tells the calling application how many entries are
	    in the buffer after calling ExAll.  Note: make sure your code
	    handles the 0 entries case, including 0 entries with continue
	    non-zero.

 LastKey:  This field ABSOLUTELY MUST be initialised to 0 before calling
	    ExAll for the first time.  Any other value will cause nasty
	    things to happen.  If ExAll returns non-zero, then this field
	    should not be touched before making the second and subsequent
	    calls to ExAll.  Whenever ExAll returns non-zero, there are more
	    calls required before all names have been received.

	    As soon as a FALSE return is received then ExAll has completed
	    (if IoErr() returns ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES - otherwise it returns
	    the error that occured, similar to ExNext.)

 MatchString
	    If this field is NULL then all filenames will be returned.  If
	    this field is non-null then it is interpreted as a pointer to
	    a string that is used to pattern match all file names before
	    accepting them and putting them into the buffer.  The default
	    AmigaDOS caseless pattern match routine is used.  This string
	    MUST have been parsed by ParsePatternNoCase()!

 MatchFunc: 
	    Contains a pointer to a hook for a routine to decide if the entry
	    will be included in the returned list of entries.  The entry is
	    filled out first, and then passed to the hook.  If no MatchFunc is
	    to be called then this entry should be NULL.  The hook is
	    called with the following parameters (as is standard for hooks):

	    BOOL = MatchFunc( hookptr, data, typeptr )
				a0	a1	a2
	    (a0 = ptr to hook, a1 = ptr to filled in ExAllData, a2 = ptr
	     to longword of type).

	    MatchFunc should return FALSE if the entry is not to be
	    accepted, otherwise return TRUE.

	Note that Dos will emulate ExAll() using Examine() and ExNext()
	if the handler in question doesn't support the ExAll() packet.

   INPUTS
	lock    - Lock on directory to be examined.
		  NOTE: Not all file systems will accept a 0 lock here.
	buffer  - Buffer for data returned (MUST be at least word-aligned,
		  preferably long-word aligned).
	size    - Size in bytes of 'buffer'.
	type    - Type of data to be returned.
	control - Control data structure (see notes above).  MUST have been
		  allocated by AllocDosObject!

   RESULT
	continue - Whether or not ExAll is done.  If FALSE is returned, either
		   ExAll has completed (IoErr() == ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES), or
		   an error occurred (check IoErr()).  If non-zero is returned,
		   you MUST call ExAll again until it returns FALSE.

   EXAMPLE

   eac = AllocDosObject(DOS_EXALLCONTROL,NULL);
   if (!eac) ...
   ...
   eac->eac_LastKey = 0;
   do {
       more = ExAll(lock, EAData, sizeof(EAData), ED_FOO, eac);
       if ((!more) && (IoErr() != ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES)) {
           \* ExAll failed abnormally *\
           break;
       }
       if (eac->eac_Entries == 0) {
           \* ExAll failed normally with no entries *\
           continue;                   \* ("more" is *usually* zero) *\
       }
       ead = (struct ExAllData *) EAData;
       do {
           \* use ead here *\
           ...
           \* get next ead *\
           ead = ead->ed_Next;
       } while (ead);

   } while (more);
   ...
   FreeDosObject(DOS_EXALLCONTROL,eac);

   BUGS
	In V36, there were problems with ExAll (particularily with
	eac_MatchString, and ed_Next with the ramdisk and the emulation
	of it in Dos for handlers that do not support the packet.  It is
	advised you only use this under V37 and later.
	The V39 DirCache variant of the FFS had a bug in ExAll that
	required to first Examine() the lock before passing it to ExAll.
	This was fixed in V40, with a patch in SetPatch.
	The V40 version passed an invalid argument to the dos.library
	error report handler in case of trouble, potentially causing
	crashes or other mischiefs. This was fixed in V47, with a patch
	in SetPatch V45.

	See note above regarding extensions to the Type parameter.

    SYNOPSIS
	success = Examine( lock, FileInfoBlock )
	D0		    D1	      D2

	BOOL Examine(BPTR,struct FileInfoBlock *)

    FUNCTION
	Examine() fills in information in the FileInfoBlock concerning the

	a return code of zero if it fails.

	You may make a local copy of the FileInfoBlock, as long as it is
	never passed to ExNext().

    INPUTS
	lock	  - BCPL pointer to a lock

    NAME
	Execute -- Execute a CLI command

    SYNOPSIS
	success = Execute( commandString, input, output )
	D0		   D1		  D2	 D3

	BOOL Execute(STRPTR, BPTR, BPTR)

    FUNCTION
	This function attempts to execute the string commandString as a
	Shell command and arguments. The string can contain any valid input
	that you could type directly in a Shell, including input and output
	redirection using < and >.  Note that Execute() doesn't return until
	the command(s) in commandstring have returned.

	The input file handle will normally be zero, and in this case
	Execute() will perform whatever was requested in the commandString
	and then return. If the input file handle is nonzero then after the
	(possibly empty) commandString is performed subsequent input is read
	from the specified input file handle until end of that file is
	reached.

	In most cases the output file handle must be provided, and is used
	by the Shell commands as their output stream unless output
	redirection was specified. If the output file handle is set to zero
	then the current window, normally specified as *, is used. Note
	that programs running under the Workbench do not normally have a
	current window.

	Execute() may also be used to create a new interactive Shell process
	just like those created with the NewShell command. In order to do
	this you would call Execute() with an empty commandString, and pass
	a file handle relating to a new window as the input file handle.
	The output file handle would be set to zero. The Shell will read
	commands from the new window, and will use the same window for
	output. This new Shell window can only be terminated by using the
	EndCLI command.

	Under V37, if an input filehandle is passed, and it's either
	interactive or a NIL: filehandle, the pr_ConsoleTask of the new
	process will be set to that filehandle's process (the same applies
	to SystemTagList()).

	For this command to work the program Run must be present in C: in
	versions before V36 (except that in 1.3.2 and any later 1.3 versions,
	the system first checks the resident list for Run).

    INPUTS
	commandString - pointer to a null-terminated string
	input	      - BCPL pointer to a file handle
	output	      - BCPL pointer to a file handle

    RESULTS
	success - BOOLEAN indicating whether Execute was successful
		  in finding and starting the specified program.  Note this
		  is NOT the return code of the command(s).

    NAME
	Exit -- Exit from a program

    SYNOPSIS
	Exit( returnCode )
	      D1

	void Exit(LONG)

    FUNCTION
	Exit() is currently for use with programs written as if they
	were BCPL programs.  This function is not normally useful for
	other purposes.

	In general, therefore, please DO NOT CALL THIS FUNCTION!

	In order to exit, C programs should use the C language exit()
	function (note the lower case letter "e").  Assembly programs should
	place a return code in D0, and execute an RTS instruction with
	their original stack ptr.

    IMPLEMENTATION
	The action of Exit() depends on whether the program which called it
	is running as a command under a CLI or not. If the program is
	running under the CLI the command finishes and control reverts to
	the CLI. In this case, returnCode is interpreted as the return code
	from the program.

	If the program is running as a distinct process, Exit() deletes the
	process and release the space associated with the stack, segment
	list and process structure.

	returnCode - integer

    NAME
	ExNext -- Examine the next entry in a directory

    SYNOPSIS
	success = ExNext( lock, FileInfoBlock )
	D0		   D1	     D2

	BOOL ExNext(BPTR, struct FileInfoBlock *)

    FUNCTION
	This routine is passed a directory lock and a FileInfoBlock that
	have been initialized by a previous call to Examine(), or updated
	by a previous call to ExNext().  ExNext() gives a return code of zero
	on failure.  The most common cause of failure is reaching the end
	of the list of files in the owning directory.  In this case, IoErr
	will return ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES and a good exit is appropriate.

	So, follow these steps to examine a directory:
	1) Pass a Lock and a FileInfoBlock to Examine().  The lock must
	   be on the directory you wish to examine.
	2) Pass ExNext() the same lock and FileInfoBlock.
	3) Do something with the information returned in the FileInfoBlock.
	   Note that the fib_DirEntryType field is positive for directories,
	   negative for files.
	4) Keep calling ExNext() until it returns FALSE.  Check IoErr()
	   to ensure that the reason for failure was ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES.

	Note: if you wish to recursively scan the file tree and you find
	another directory while ExNext()ing you must Lock that directory and
	Examine() it using a new FileInfoBlock.  Use of the same
	FileInfoBlock to enter a directory would lose important state
	information such that it will be impossible to continue scanning
	the parent directory.  While it is permissible to UnLock() and Lock()
	the parent directory between ExNext() calls, this is NOT recommended.
	Important state information is associated with the parent lock, so
	if it is freed between ExNext() calls this information has to be
	rebuilt on each new ExNext() call, and will significantly slow down
	directory scanning.

	It is NOT legal to Examine() a file, and then to ExNext() from that
	FileInfoBlock.	You may make a local copy of the FileInfoBlock, as
	long as it is never passed back to the operating system.

    INPUTS
	lock - BCPL pointer to a lock originally used for the Examine() call
	       This lock shall be non-zero. Unlike Examine(), ExNext() does
	       not support the 0 lock.
	infoBlock - pointer to a FileInfoBlock used on the previous Examine()
		    or ExNext() call.

    RESULTS
	success - boolean

    SPECIAL NOTE
	FileInfoBlock must be longword-aligned.  AllocDosObject() will
	allocate them correctly for you.

   SYNOPSIS
	len = Fault(code, header, buffer, len)
	D0           D1     D2      D3    D4

	LONG Fault(LONG, STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	This routine obtains the error message text for the given error code.
	The header is prepended to the text of the error message, followed
	by a colon.  Puts a null-terminated string for the error message into
	the buffer.  By convention, error messages should be no longer than 80
	characters (+1 for termination), and preferably no more than 60.
	The value returned by IoErr() is set to the code passed in.  If there
	is no message for the error code, the message will be "Error code
	<number>\n".

	The number of characters put into the buffer is returned, which will
	be 0 if the code passed in was 0.

   INPUTS
	code   - Error code
	header - header to output before error text
	buffer - Buffer to receive error message.
	len    - Length of the buffer.

   RESULT
	len    - number of characters put into buffer (may be 0)

   BUGS
	In older documentation, the return was shown as BOOL success.  This
	was incorrect, it has always returned the length.

   SYNOPSIS
	char = FGetC(fh)
	D0	     D1

	LONG FGetC(BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Reads the next character from the input stream.  A -1 is
	returned when EOF or an error is encountered.  This call is buffered.
	Use Flush() between buffered and unbuffered I/O on a filehandle.

   INPUTS
	fh - filehandle to use for buffered I/O

   RESULT
	char - character read (0-255) or -1

   BUGS
	In V36, after an EOF was read, EOF would always be returned from
	FGetC() from then on.  Starting in V37, it tries to read from the
	handler again each time (unless UnGetC(fh,-1) was called).

   NAME
	FGets -- Reads a line from the specified input (buffered) (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	buffer = FGets(fh, buf, len)
	D0             D1  D2   D3

	STRPTR FGets(BPTR, STRPTR, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	This routine reads in a single line from the specified input stopping
	at a NEWLINE character or EOF.  In either event, UP TO the number of
	len specified bytes minus 1 will be copied into the buffer.  Hence if
	a length of 50 is passed and the input line is longer than 49 bytes,
	it will return 49 characters.  It returns the buffer pointer normally,
	or NULL if EOF is the first thing read.

	If terminated by a newline, the newline WILL be the last character in
	the buffer.  This is a buffered read routine.  The string read in IS
	null-terminated.

	See the BUGS section for the conditions under which the string is
	never null-terminated.

   INPUTS
	fh  - filehandle to use for buffered I/O
	buf - Area to read bytes into.
	len - Number of bytes to read, must be > 0.

   RESULT
	buffer - Pointer to buffer passed in, or NULL for immediate EOF or for
		 an error.
		 If NULL is returned for an EOF, IoErr() will return 0.

   NOTES
	The dos FGets() function is patterned after the 'C' standard I/O
	function fgets() but there is a crucial difference which can
	produce buffer overflows: FGets() uses an unsigned length parameter
	whereas fgets() uses a signed integer. If you accidentally pass a
	negative length to fgets() it will stop immediately. But if you do
	the same with FGets(), the length will be interpreted as a very large
	unsigned number. This is what can lead to a string buffer overflow
	which could corrupt data and lead to undefined behaviour.

   BUGS
	In V36 and V37, it copies one more byte than it should if it doesn't
	hit an EOF or newline.  In the example above, it would copy 50 bytes
	and put a null in the 51st.  This is fixed in dos V39.  Workaround
	for V36/V37: pass in buffersize-1.

	The dos V39 fix for the buffer overflow has a side-effect in that
	if you accidentally pass length=0 then FGets() will effectively use a
	buffer size of 4294967295 characters. Regardless of its size, your
	buffer may be subject to overflow if this occurs. Buffer overflows
	can corrupt data and lead to undefined behaviour.
	This is fixed in dos 47.27. Passing length=0 will make FGets() return
	NULL with IoErr() returning 0, indicating an EOF condition. Nothing
	will be written to the buffer. No null-termination will be provided
	for a buffer of size 0.

   NAME
	FilePart -- Returns the last component of a path (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	fileptr = FilePart( path )
	D0		     D1

	STRPTR FilePart( STRPTR )

   FUNCTION
	This function returns a pointer to the last component of a string path
	specification, which will normally be the file name.  If there is only
	one component, it returns a pointer to the beginning of the string.

   INPUTS
	path - pointer to an path string.  May be relative to the current
	       directory or the current disk.

   RESULT
	fileptr - pointer to the last component of the path.

   EXAMPLE
	FilePart("xxx:yyy/zzz/qqq") would return a pointer to the first 'q'.
	FilePart("xxx:yyy") would return a pointer to the first 'y').

   NAME
	FindSegment - Finds a segment on the resident list (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	segment = FindSegment(name, start, system)
	D0		       D1     D2     D3

	struct Segment *FindSegment(STRPTR, struct Segment *, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Finds a segment on the Dos resident list by name and type, starting
	at the segment AFTER 'start', or at the beginning if start is NULL.
	If system is zero, it will only return nodes with a seg_UC of 0
	or more.  It does NOT increment the seg_UC, and it does NOT do any
	locking of the list.  You must Forbid() lock the list to use this
	call.

	To use an entry you have found, you must: if the seg_UC is 0 or more,
	increment it, and decrement it (under Forbid()!) when you're done
	with the seglist.

	The other values for seg_UC are:
		-1   - system module, such as a filesystem or shell
		-2   - resident shell command
		-999 - disabled internal command, ignore
	Negative values should never be modified.  All other negative
	values between 0 and -32767 are reserved to AmigaDos and should not
	be used.

   INPUTS
	name   - name of segment to find
	start  - segment to start the search after
	system - true for system segment, false for normal segments

   RESULT
	segment - the segment found or NULL

   NAME
	Flush -- Flushes buffers for a buffered filehandle (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = Flush(fh)
	D0		D1

	LONG Flush(BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Flushes any pending buffered writes to the filehandle.  All buffered
	writes will also be flushed on Close().  If the filehandle was being
	used for input, it drops the buffer, and tries to Seek() back to the
	last read position  (so subsequent reads or writes will occur at the
	expected position in the file).

   INPUTS
	fh	- Filehandle to flush.

   RESULT
	success - Success or failure.

   BUGS
	Before V37 release, Flush() returned a random value.  As of V37,
	it always returns success (this will be fixed in some future
	release).

	The V36 and V37 releases didn't properly flush filehandles which
	have never had a buffered IO done on them.  This commonly occurs
	on redirection of input of a command, or when opening a file for
	input and then calling CreateNewProc() with NP_Arguments, or when
	using a new filehandle with SelectInput() and then calling
	RunCommand().  This is fixed in V39.  A workaround would be to
	do FGetC(), then UnGetC(), then Flush().

   SYNOPSIS
	success = Format(filesystem, volumename, dostype)
	D0                   D1          D2         D3

	BOOL Format(STRPTR, STRPTR, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	Interface for initializing new media on a device.  This causes the
	filesystem to write out an empty disk structure to the media, which
	should then be ready for use.  This assumes the media has been low-
	level formatted and verified already.

	The filesystem should be inhibited before calling Format() to make
	sure you don't get an ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE.

   INPUTS
	filesystem - Name of device to be formatted.  ':' must be supplied.
	volumename - Name for volume (if supported).  No ':'.
	dostype    - Type of format, if filesystem supports multiple types.

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator.

   BUGS
	Existed, but was non-functional in V36 dos.  (The volumename wasn't
	converted to a BSTR.)  Workaround: require V37, or under V36
	convert volumename to a BPTR to a BSTR before calling Format().
	Note: a number of printed packet docs for ACTION_FORMAT are wrong
	as to the arguments.

	D0           D1   D2

	LONG FPutC(BPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Writes a single character to the output stream.  This call is
	buffered.  Use Flush() between buffered and unbuffered I/O on a
	filehandle.  Interactive filehandles are flushed automatically
	on a newline, return, '\0', or line feed.

   INPUTS
	fh   - filehandle to use for buffered I/O
	char - character to write

   RESULT
	char - either the character written, or EOF for an error.

   BUGS
	Older autodocs indicated that you should pass a UBYTE.  The
	correct usage is to pass a LONG in the range 0-255.

	blocklen - number of bytes per block.  Must be > 0.
	blocks	 - number of blocks to read.  Must be > 0.

   RESULT
	count - Number of _blocks_ read, or 0 for EOF.  On an error, the
		number of blocks actually read is returned.

   BUGS
	Doesn't clear IoErr() before starting.  If you want to find out
	about errors, use SetIoErr(0L) before calling.
	This call was implemented as a series of FGetC() under V45

	struct DevProc *GetDeviceProc(STRPTR, struct DevProc *)

   FUNCTION
	Finds the handler/filesystem to send packets regarding 'name' to.
	This may involve getting temporary locks.  It returns a structure
	that includes a lock and msgport to send to to attempt your operation.
	It also includes information on how to handle multiple-directory
	assigns (by passing the DevProc back to GetDeviceProc() until it
	returns NULL).

	The initial call to GetDeviceProc() should pass NULL for devproc.  If
	after using the returned DevProc, you get an ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND,
	and (devproc->dvp_Flags & DVPF_ASSIGN) is true, you should call
	GetDeviceProc() again, passing it the devproc structure.  It will
	either return a modified devproc structure, or NULL (with
	ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES in IoErr()).  Continue until it returns NULL.

	This call also increments the counter that locks a handler/fs into
	memory.  After calling FreeDeviceProc(), do not use the port or lock
	again!

   INPUTS
	name    - name of the object you wish to access.  This can be a
		  relative path ("foo/bar"), relative to the current volume
		  (":foo/bar"), or relative to a device/volume/assign
		  ("foo:bar").
	devproc - A value returned by GetDeviceProc() before, or NULL

   RESULT

   BUGS
	Counter not currently active in 2.0.
	In 2.0 and 2.01, you HAD to check DVPF_ASSIGN before calling it again.

   NAME
	GetVar -- Returns the value of a local or global variable (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	len = GetVar( name, buffer, size, flags ) 
	D0	       D1     D2     D3    D4

	LONG GetVar( STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG, ULONG ) 

   FUNCTION
	Gets the value of a local or environment variable.  It is advised to
 	only use ASCII strings inside variables, but not required.  This stops
	putting characters into the destination when a \n is hit, unless
	GVF_BINARY_VAR is specified.  (The \n is not stored in the buffer.)

   INPUTS
	name   - pointer to a variable name.
	buffer - a user allocated area which will be used to store
		 the value associated with the variable.
	size   - length of the buffer region in bytes.
	flags  - combination of type of var to get value of (low 8 bits), and
		 flags to control the behavior of this routine.  Currently
		 defined flags include:

			GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY - tries to get a global env variable.
			GVF_LOCAL_ONLY  - tries to get a local variable.
			GVF_BINARY_VAR  - don't stop at \n
			GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM - no null termination (only valid
					  for binary variables). (V37)

		 The default is to try to get a local variable first, then
		 to try to get a global environment variable.

   RESULT
	len -   Size of environment variable.  -1 indicates that the
		variable was not defined (if IoErr() returns
		ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND - it returns ERROR_BAD_NUMBER if
		you specify a size of 0).  If the value would overflow
		the user buffer, the buffer is truncated.  The buffer
		returned is null-terminated (even if GVF_BINARY_VAR is
		used, unless GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM is in effect).  If it
		succeeds, len is the number of characters put in the buffer
		(not including null termination), and IoErr() will return the
		the size of the variable (regardless of buffer size).

   BUGS
	LV_VAR is the only type that can be global.
	Under V36, we documented (and it returned) the size of the variable,
	not the number of characters transferred.  For V37 this was changed
	to the number of characters put in the buffer, and the total size
	of the variable is put in IoErr().
	GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM only works for local variables under V37.  For
	V39, it also works for globals.

   NAME
	InternalLoadSeg -- Low-level load routine (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	seglist = InternalLoadSeg(fh,table,functionarray,stack)
	D0			  D0  A0        A1	  A2

	BPTR InternalLoadSeg(BPTR,BPTR,LONG *,LONG *)

   FUNCTION
	Loads from fh.  Table is used when loading an overlay, otherwise
	should be NULL.  Functionarray is a pointer to an array of functions.
	Note that the current Seek position after loading may be at any point
	after the last hunk loaded.  The filehandle will not be closed.  If a
	stacksize is encoded in the file, the size will be stuffed in the
	LONG pointed to by stack.  This LONG should be initialized to your
	default value: InternalLoadSeg() will not change it if no stacksize
	is found. Clears unused portions of Code and Data hunks (as well as
	BSS hunks).  (This also applies to LoadSeg() and NewLoadSeg()).

	If the file being loaded is an overlaid file, this will return
	-(seglist).  All other results will be positive.

	NOTE to overlay users: InternalLoadSeg() does NOT return seglist in
	both D0 and D1, as LoadSeg does.  The current ovs.asm uses LoadSeg(),
	and assumes returns are in D1.  We will support this for LoadSeg()
	ONLY.

   INPUTS
	fh	      - Filehandle to load from.
	table	      - When loading an overlay, otherwise ignored.
	functionarray - Array of function to be used for read, alloc, and free.
	   FuncTable[0] ->  Actual = ReadFunc(readhandle,buffer,length),DOSBase

	D0                     D1

	BOOL IsFileSystem(STRPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Returns whether the device is a filesystem or not.  A filesystem
	supports seperate files storing information.  It may also support
	sub-directories, but is not required to.  If the filesystem doesn't
	support this new packet, IsFileSystem() will use Lock(":",...) as

    NAME
	LoadSeg -- Scatterload a loadable file into memory

    SYNOPSIS
	seglist = LoadSeg( name [,table, fh] )
	D0		   D1       D2    D3

	BPTR LoadSeg(STRPTR [,BPTR, BPTR] )

    FUNCTION
	The file 'name' should be a load module produced by the linker.
	LoadSeg() scatterloads the CODE, DATA and BSS segments into memory,
	chaining together the segments with BPTR's on their first words.
	The end of the chain is indicated by a zero.  There can be any number
	of segments in a file.  All necessary relocation is handled by
	LoadSeg().

	In the event of an error any blocks loaded will be unloaded and a
	NULL result returned.

	If the module is correctly loaded then the output will be a pointer
	at the beginning of the list of blocks. Loaded code is unloaded via
	a call to UnLoadSeg().

    NOTES
	While this function is generally documented to take only a single
	argument, and the Os prototypes only document the one-argument
	variant, it actually takes two additional arguments in D2 and D3
	if the first argument is NULL. This calling convention of LoadSeg()
	is used for programs using overlay segments, and then loads an
	overlay segment according to the hunk table in D2, from the file
	handle in D3.

    INPUTS
	name  - pointer to a null-terminated string, or NULL.
	table - BPTR to a hunk table, only used for overlayed segments.
	fh    - BPTR to a file handle from which the overlayed segment
	        is loaded.

    RESULTS
	seglist - BCPL pointer to a seglist
		  In case name is non-NULL and scatter loading aborted
		  due to a HUNK_STOP, i.e. an overlayed binary was found,
		  LoadSeg() checks whether the first hunk has at offset 8
		  the magic long word constant $ABCD. The binary shall
		  reserve four long words following this magic identifier.
		  The four long words are then filled in as follows:
		  - overlay file handle. This is to be used for loading
		    subsequent overlay segments, and shall be passed in
		    D3 to continue scatter loading. This file handle is
		    closed by UnLoadSeg().
		  - pointer to the overlay table, the contents of the
		    HUNK_OVERLAY.
		  - global vector of the dos.library, for BCPL code,
		    also required for UnLoadSeg().

    NAME
	Lock -- Lock a directory or file

    SYNOPSIS
	lock  = Lock( name, accessMode )
	D0	      D1	D2

	BPTR Lock(STRPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	A filing system lock on the file or directory 'name' is returned if
	possible.

	If the accessMode is ACCESS_READ, the lock is a shared read lock;
	if the accessMode is ACCESS_WRITE then it is an exclusive write
	lock.  Do not use random values for mode.

	If Lock() fails (that is, if it cannot obtain a filing system lock
	on the file or directory) it returns a zero.

	Tricky assumptions about the internal format of a lock are unwise,
	as are any attempts to use the fl_Link or fl_Access fields.

    INPUTS

   NAME
	LockDosList -- Locks the specified Dos Lists for use (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	dlist = LockDosList(flags)
	D0		     D1

	struct DosList *LockDosList(ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	Locks the dos device list in preparation to walk the list.
	If the list is 'busy' then this routine will not return until it is 
	available.  This routine "nests": you can call it multiple times, and
	then must unlock it the same number of times.  The dlist
	returned is NOT a valid entry: it is a special value.  Note that
	for 1.3 compatibility, it also does a Forbid() - this will probably
	be removed at some future time.  The 1.3 Forbid() locking of this
	list had some race conditions.  The pointer returned by this is NOT
	an actual DosList pointer - you should use on of the other DosEntry
	calls to get actual pointers to DosList structures (such as
	NextDosEntry()), passing the value returned by LockDosList()
	as the dlist value.

	Note for handler writers: you should never call this function with
	LDF_WRITE, since it can deadlock you (if someone has it read-locked
	and they're trying to send you a packet).  Use AttemptLockDosList()
	instead, and effectively busy-wait with delays for the list to be
	available.  The other option is that you can spawn a process to
	add the entry safely.

	As an example, here's how you can search for all volumes of a specific
	name and do something with them:

	2.0 way:

		dl = LockDosList(LDF_VOLUMES|LDF_READ);
		while (dl = FindDosEntry(dl,name,LDF_VOLUMES))
		{
			Add to list of volumes to process or break out of
			the while loop.
			(You could try using it here, but I advise
			against it for compatability reasons if you
			are planning on continuing to examine the list.)
		}
		
		process list of volumes saved above, or current entry if
		you're only interested in the first one of that name.

		UnLockDosList(LDF_VOLUMES|LDF_READ);
				  \* must not use dl after this! *\

	1.3/2.0 way:

		if (version >= 36)
			dl = LockDosList(LDF_VOLUMES|LDF_READ);
		else {
			Forbid();
			/* tricky! note dol_Next is at offset 0! */
			dl = &(...->di_DeviceList);
		}

		while (version >= 36 ?
				dl = FindDosEntry(dl,name,LDF_VOLUMES) :
			        dl = yourfindentry(dl,name,DLT_VOLUME))
		{
			Add to list of volumes to process, or break out of
			the while loop.
			Do NOT lock foo1/foo2 here if you will continue
			to examine the list - it breaks the forbid
			and the list may change on you.
		}
		
		process list of volumes saved above, or current entry if
		you're only interested in the first one of that name.

		if (version >= 36)
			UnLockDosList(LDF_VOLUMES|LDF_READ);
		else
			Permit();
		\* must not use dl after this! *\
		...

		struct DosList *
		yourfindentry (struct DosList *dl, STRPTRname, type)
		{
		\* tricky - depends on dol_Next being at offset 0,
		   and the initial ptr being a ptr to di_DeviceList! *\
			while (dl = dl->dol_Next)
			{
			    if (dl->dol_Type == type &&
				stricmp(name,BADDR(dl->dol_Name)+1) == 0)
			    {
				break;
			    }
			}
			return dl;
		}

   INPUTS
	flags - Flags stating which types of nodes you want to lock.

   RESULT
	dlist - Pointer to the head of the list.  NOT a valid node!

   NAME
	LockRecord -- Locks a portion of a file (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = LockRecord(fh,offset,length,mode,timeout)
	D0                   D1   D2     D3    D4    D5

	BOOL LockRecord(BPTR,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	This locks a portion of a file for exclusive access.  Timeout is how
	long to wait in ticks (1/50 sec) for the record to be available.

	Valid modes are:
		REC_EXCLUSIVE
		REC_EXCLUSIVE_IMMED
		REC_SHARED
		REC_SHARED_IMMED
	For the IMMED modes, the timeout is ignored.

	Record locks are tied to the filehandle used to create them.  The
	same filehandle can get any number of exclusive locks on the same
	record, for example.  These are cooperative locks, they only
	affect other people calling LockRecord().

   INPUTS
	fh      - File handle for which to lock the record
	offset  - Record start position
	length  - Length of record in bytes
	mode    - Type of lock requester
	timeout - Timeout interval in ticks.  0 is legal.

   RESULT
	success - Success or failure

   BUGS
	In 2.0 through 2.02 (V36), LockRecord() only worked in the ramdisk.
	Attempting to lock records on the disk filesystem causes a crash.
	This was fixed for V37.

	Timeout is how long to wait in ticks for the records to be available.
	The wait is applied to each attempt to lock each record in the list.
	It is recommended that you always lock a set of records in the same
	order to reduce possibilities of deadlock.

	The array of RecordLock structures is terminated by an entry with
	rec_FH of NULL.

   INPUTS
	record_array - List of records to be locked

   SYNOPSIS
	success = MakeLink( name, dest, soft )
	D0		     D1    D2    D3

	BOOL MakeLink( STRPTR, LONG, LONG )

   FUNCTION
	Create a filesystem link from 'name' to dest.  For "soft-links",
	dest is a pointer to a null-terminated path string.  For "hard-
	links", dest is a lock (BPTR).  'soft' is FALSE for hard-links,
	non-zero otherwise.

	Soft-links are resolved at access time by a combination of the
	filesystem (by returning ERROR_IS_SOFT_LINK to dos), and by
	Dos (using ReadLink() to resolve any links that are hit).

	Hard-links are resolved by the filesystem in question.  A series
	of hard-links to a file are all equivalent to the file itself.
	If one of the links (or the original entry for the file) is 
	deleted, the data remains until there are no links left.

   INPUTS
	name - Name of the link to create
	dest - CPTR to path string, or BPTR lock
	soft - FALSE for hard-links, non-zero for soft-links

   RESULT
	Success - boolean

   BUGS
	In V36, soft-links didn't work in the ROM filesystem.  This was
	fixed for V37.

   NAME
	MatchFirst -- Finds file that matches pattern (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	error = MatchFirst(pat, AnchorPath)
	D0                 D1       D2

	LONG MatchFirst(STRPTR, struct AnchorPath *)

   FUNCTION
	Locates the first file or directory that matches a given pattern.
	MatchFirst() is passed your pattern (you do not pass it through
	ParsePattern() - MatchFirst() does that for you), and the control
	structure.  MatchFirst() normally initializes your AnchorPath
	structure for you, and returns the first file that matched your
	pattern, or an error.  Note that MatchFirst()/MatchNext() are unusual
	for Dos in that they return 0 for success, or the error code (see
	<dos/dos.h>), instead of the application getting the error code
	from IoErr().

	When looking at the result of MatchFirst()/MatchNext(), the ap_Info
	field of your AnchorPath has the results of an Examine() of the object.
	You normally get the name of the object from fib_FileName, and the
	directory it's in from ap_Current->an_Lock.  To access this object,
	normally you would temporarily CurrentDir() to the lock, do an action
	to the file/dir, and then CurrentDir() back to your original directory.
	This makes certain you affect the right object even when two volumes
	of the same name are in the system.  You can use ap_Buf (with
	ap_Strlen) to get a name to report to the user.

	To initialize the AnchorPath structure (particularily when reusing
	it), set ap_BreakBits to the signal bits (CDEF) that you want to take
	a break on, or NULL, if you don't want to convenience the user.
	ap_Flags should be set to any flags you need or all 0's otherwise.
	ap_FoundBreak should be cleared if you'll be using breaks.

	If you want to have the FULL PATH NAME of the files you found,
	allocate a buffer at the END of this structure, and put the size of
	it into ap_Strlen.  If you don't want the full path name, make sure
	you set ap_Strlen to zero.  In this case, the name of the file, and
	stats are available in the ap_Info, as per usual.

	Then call MatchFirst() and then afterwards, MatchNext() with this
	structure.  You should check the return value each time (see below)
	and take the appropriate action, ultimately calling MatchEnd() when
	there are no more files or you are done.  You can tell when you are
	done by checking for the normal AmigaDOS return code
	ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES.

	Note: patterns with trailing slashes may cause MatchFirst()/MatchNext()
	to return with an ap_Current->an_Lock on the object, and a filename
	of the empty string ("").

	See ParsePattern() for more information on the patterns.

   INPUTS
	pat        - Pattern to search for
	AnchorPath - Place holder for search.  MUST be longword aligned!

   RESULT
	error - 0 for success or error code.  (Opposite of most Dos calls!)

   BUGS
	In V36, there were a number of bugs with MatchFirst()/MatchNext().
	One was that if you entered a directory with a name like "df0:l"
	using DODIR, it would re-lock the full string "df0:l", which can
	cause problems if the disk has changed.  It also had problems
	with patterns such as #?/abc/def - the ap_Current->an_Lock would
	not be on the directory def is found in.  ap_Buf would be correct,
	however.  It had similar problems with patterns with trailing
	slashes.  These have been fixed for V37 and later.

	A bug that has not been fixed for V37 concerns a pattern of a
	single directory name (such as "l").  If you enter such a directory
	via DODIR, it re-locks l relative to the current directory.  Thus
	you must not change the current directory before calling MatchNext()
	with DODIR in that situation.  If you aren't using DODIR to enter
	directories you can ignore this.  This may be fixed in some upcoming
	release.

	In case the pattern does not contain any wildcards, and refers to
	a softlink that cannot be resolved, MatchFirst() returns
	ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND. A workaround is to replace the file name
	by a pattern that resolves only to this particular file name, e.g.
	foo -> foo(|).

   FUNCTION
	Returns a fully qualified path for the lock.  This routine is
	guaranteed not to write more than len characters into the buffer.  The
	name will be null-terminated.  NOTE: if the volume is not mounted,
	the system will request it (unless of course you set pr_WindowPtr to
	-1).  If the volume is not mounted or inserted, it will return an
	error.  If the lock passed in is NULL, "SYS:" will be returned. If
	the buffer is too short, an error will be returned, and IoErr() will
	return ERROR_LINE_TOO_LONG.

   INPUTS
	lock   - Lock of object to be examined.
	buffer - Buffer to store name.
	len    - Length of buffer.

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator.

   NOTES
	Unless the lock passed in is NULL, this function requires a shared
	lock to work. If an exclusive lock is used, it will return an error.

   BUGS
	Should return the name of the boot volume instead of SYS: for a NULL

	BPTR NewLoadSegTags(STRPTR, ...)

   FUNCTION
	Does a LoadSeg on a file, and takes additional actions based on the
	tags supplied.

	Clears unused portions of Code and Data hunks (as well as BSS hunks).
	(This also applies to InternalLoadSeg() and LoadSeg()).

	NOTE to overlay users: NewLoadSeg() does NOT return seglist in
	both D0 and D1, as LoadSeg does.  The current ovs.asm uses LoadSeg(),
	and assumes returns are in D1.  We will support this for LoadSeg()
	ONLY.

   INPUTS
	file - Filename of file to load, shall not be NULL.
	tags - pointer to tagitem array

   RESULT
	seglist - Seglist loaded, or NULL

   BUGS
	No tags are currently defined. This call runs into the function
	as LoadSeg(), and thus misinterprets the tags in case the
	name pointer is NULL.

	Open -- Open a file for input or output

    SYNOPSIS
	file = Open( name, accessMode )
	D0	     D1    D2

	BPTR Open(STRPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	The named file is opened and a file handle returned.  If the
	accessMode is MODE_OLDFILE, an existing file is opened for reading
	or writing. If the value is MODE_NEWFILE, a new file is created for
	writing. MODE_READWRITE opens a file with an shared lock, but
	creates it if it didn't exist.  Open types are documented in the
	<dos/dos.h> or <libraries/dos.h> include file.

	The 'name' can be a filename (optionally prefaced by a device
	name), a simple device such as NIL:, a window specification such as
	CON: or RAW: followed by window parameters, or "*", representing the
	current console whose port is found in pr_ConsoleTask. From V36
	onwards, the current console can also be reached at "CONSOLE:" or
	"CONSOLE:spec", where the interpretation of the specification
	behind "CONSOLE:" is specific to the handler implementing the
	console. The ROM con-handler ignores this optional string.

	If the file cannot be opened for any reason, the value returned
	will be zero, and a secondary error code will be available by
	calling the routine IoErr().

    INPUTS
	name	   - pointer to a null-terminated string

   SYNOPSIS
	fh = OpenFromLock(lock)
	D0                 D1

	BPTR OpenFromLock(BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Given a lock, this routine performs an open on that lock.  If the open
	succeeds, the lock is (effectively) relinquished, and should not be
	UnLock()ed or used.  If the open fails, the lock is still usable.
	The lock associated with the file internally is of the same access
	mode as the lock you gave up - shared is similar to MODE_OLDFILE,
	exclusive is similar to MODE_NEWFILE.

   INPUTS
	lock - Lock on object to be opened.

   RESULT
	fh   - Newly opened file handle or NULL for failure

   BUGS
	In the original V36 autodocs, this was shown (incorrectly) as
	taking a Mode parameter as well.  The prototypes and pragmas were

	d0                      D1     D2      D3

	LONG ParsePattern(STRPTR, STRPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Tokenizes a pattern, for use by MatchPattern().  Also indicates if
	there are any wildcards in the pattern (i.e. whether it might match
	more than one item).  Note that Dest must be at least 2 times as
	large as Source plus bytes to be (almost) 100% certain of no
	buffer overflow.  This is because each input character can currently
	expand to 2 tokens (with one exception that can expand to 3, but
	only once per string).  Note: this implementation may change in
	the future, so you should handle error returns in all cases, but
	the size above should still be a reasonable upper bound for a buffer
	allocation.

	The patterns are fairly extensive, and approximate some of the ability
	of Unix/grep "regular expression" patterns.  Here are the available
	tokens:

	?	Matches a single character.
	#	Matches the following expression 0 or more times.
	(ab|cd)	Matches any one of the items seperated by '|'.
	~	Negates the following expression.  It matches all strings
		that do not match the expression (aka ~(foo) matches all
		strings that are not exactly "foo").
	[abc]	Character class: matches any of the characters in the class.
	[~bc]	Character class: matches any of the characters not in the
		class.
	a-z	Character range (only within character classes). 
	%	Matches 0 characters always (useful in "(foo|bar|%)").
	*	Synonym for "#?", not available by default in 2.0.  Available
		as an option that can be turned on.

	"Expression" in the above table means either a single character
	(ex: "#?"), or an alternation (ex: "#(ab|cd|ef)"), or a character
	class (ex: "#[a-zA-Z]").

   INPUTS
	source     - unparsed wildcard string to search for.
       dest       - output string, gets tokenized version of input.
	DestLength - length available in destination (should be at least as
		     twice as large as source + 2 bytes).

   RESULT
	IsWild - 1 means there were wildcards in the pattern,
		 0 means there were no wildcards in the pattern,
		-1 means there was a buffer overflow or other error

   BUGS
	In V37 this call didn't always set IoErr() to something useful on an
	error.  Fixed in V39.

   FUNCTION
	This function returns a pointer to the character after the next-to-last

    NAME
	Read -- Read bytes of data from a file

    SYNOPSIS
	actualLength = Read( file, buffer, length )
	D0		     D1    D2	   D3

	LONG Read(BPTR, void *, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	Data can be copied using a combination of Read() and Write().
	Read() reads bytes of information from an opened file (represented
	here by the argument 'file') into the buffer given. The argument
	'length' is the length of the buffer given.

	The value returned is the length of the information actually read.
	So, when 'actualLength' is greater than zero, the value of
	'actualLength' is the the number of characters read. Usually Read
	will try to fill up your buffer before returning. A value of zero
	means that end-of-file has been reached. Errors are indicated by a
	value of -1.

	Note: this is an unbuffered routine, i.e.the request is passed
	directly to the filesystem. Buffered I/O is more efficient for
	small reads and writes; see FGetC().

    INPUTS
	file - BCPL pointer to a file handle
	buffer - pointer to buffer
	length - integer

   NAME
	ReadArgs - Parse the command line input (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	result = ReadArgs(template, array, rdargs)
	D0                   D1      D2      D3

	struct RDArgs * ReadArgs(STRPTR, LONG *, struct RDArgs *)

   FUNCTION
	Parses and argument string according to a template.  Normally gets
	the arguments by reading buffered IO from Input(), but also can be
	made to parse a string.  MUST be matched by a call to FreeArgs().

	ReadArgs() parses the commandline according to a template that is
	passed to it.  This specifies the different command-line options and
	their types.  A template consists of a list of options.  Options are
	named in "full" names where possible (for example, "Quick" instead of
	"Q").  Abbreviations can also be specified by using "abbrev=option"
	(for example, "Q=Quick").

	Options in the template are separated by commas.  To get the results
	of ReadArgs(), you examine the array of longwords you passed to it
	(one entry per option in the template).  This array should be cleared
	(or initialized to your default values) before passing to ReadArgs().
	Exactly what is put in a given entry by ReadArgs() depends on the type
	of option.  The default is a string (a sequence of non-whitespace
	characters, or delimited by quotes, which will be stripped by
	ReadArgs()), in which case the entry will be a pointer.

	Options can be followed by modifiers, which specify things such as
	the type of the option.  Modifiers are specified by following the
	option with a '/' and a single character modifier.  Multiple modifiers
	can be specified by using multiple '/'s.  Valid modifiers are:

	/S - Switch.  This is considered a boolean variable, and will be
	     set if the option name appears in the command-line.  The entry
	     is the boolean (0 for not set, non-zero for set).

	/K - Keyword.  This means that the option will not be filled unless
	     the keyword appears.  For example if the template is "Name/K",
	     then unless "Name=<string>" or "Name <string>" appears in the
	     command line, Name will not be filled.

	/N - Number.  This parameter is considered a decimal number, and will
	     be converted by ReadArgs.  If an invalid number is specified,
	     an error will be returned.  The entry will be a pointer to the
	     longword number (this is how you know if a number was specified).

	/T - Toggle.  This is similar to a switch, but when specified causes
	     the boolean value to "toggle".  Similar to /S.

	/A - Required.  This keyword must be given a value during command-line
	     processing, or an error is returned.

	/F - Rest of line.  If this is specified, the entire rest of the line
	     is taken as the parameter for the option, even if other option
	     keywords appear in it.

	/M - Multiple strings.  This means the argument will take any number
	     of strings, returning them as an array of strings.  Any arguments
	     not considered to be part of another option will be added to this
	     option.  Only one /M should be specified in a template.  Example:
	     for a template "Dir/M,All/S" the command-line "foo bar all qwe"
	     will set the boolean "all", and return an array consisting of
	     "foo", "bar", and "qwe".  The entry in the array will be a pointer
	     to an array of string pointers, the last of which will be NULL.

	     There is an interaction between /M parameters and /A parameters.
	     If there are unfilled /A parameters after parsing, it will grab
	     strings from the end of a previous /M parameter list to fill the
	     /A's.  This is used for things like Copy ("From/A/M,To/A").

	ReadArgs() returns a struct RDArgs if it succeeds.  This serves as an
	"anchor" to allow FreeArgs() to free the associated memory.  You can
	also pass in a struct RDArgs to control the operation of ReadArgs()
	(normally you pass NULL for the parameter, and ReadArgs() allocates
	one for you).  This allows providing different sources for the
	arguments, providing your own string buffer space for temporary
	storage, and extended help text.  See <dos/rdargs.h> for more
	information on this.  Note: if you pass in a struct RDArgs, you must
	still call FreeArgs() to release storage that gets attached to it,
	but you are responsible for freeing the RDArgs yourself.

	If you pass in a RDArgs structure, you MUST reset (clear or set)
	RDA_Buffer for each new call to RDArgs.  The exact behavior if you
	don't do this varies from release to release and case to case; don't
	count on the behavior!

	See BUGS regarding passing in strings.
	
   INPUTS
	template - formatting string
	array    - array of longwords for results, 1 per template entry
	rdargs   - optional rdargs structure for options.  AllocDosObject
		   should be used for allocating them if you pass one in.

   RESULT
	result   - a struct RDArgs or NULL for failure.

   BUGS
	In V36, there were a couple of minor bugs with certain argument
	combinations (/M/N returned strings, /T didn't work, and /K and
	/F interacted).  Also, a template with a /K before any non-switch
	parameter will require the argument name to be given in order for
	line to be accepted (i.e. "parm/K,xyzzy/A" would require
	"xyzzy=xxxxx" in order to work - "xxxxx" would not work).  If you
	need to avoid this for V36, put /K parameters after all non-switch
	parameters.  These problems should be fixed for V37.

	Currently (V37 and before) it requires any strings passed in to have
	newlines at the end of the string.  This may or may not be fixed in
	the future.

   NAME
	ReadItem - reads a single argument/name from command line (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	value = ReadItem(buffer, maxchars, input)
	D0                D1        D2      D3

	LONG ReadItem(STRPTR, LONG, struct CSource *)

   FUNCTION
	Reads a "word" from either Input() (buffered), or via CSource, if it
	is non-NULL (see <dos/rdargs.h> for more information).  Handles
	quoting and some '*' substitutions (*e and *n) inside quotes (only).
	See dos/dos.h for a listing of values returned by ReadItem()
	(ITEM_XXXX).  A "word" is delimited by whitespace, quotes, '=', or
	an EOF.

	ReadItem always unreads the last thing read (UnGetC(fh,-1)) so the
	caller can find out what the terminator was.

   INPUTS
	buffer   - buffer to store word in.
	maxchars - size of the buffer
	input    - CSource input or NULL (uses FGetC(Input()))

   RESULT
	ITEM_EQUAL	the reader detected an '=' sign
	ITEM_ERROR	an error was detected
	ITEM_NOTHING	end of the stream, new line or ';'
	ITEM_UNQUOTED	the item was read successfully and is not quoted
	ITEM_QUOTED	the item was read successfully and is quoted

   BUGS
	Doesn't actually unread the terminator.

   NAME
	ReadLink -- Reads the path for a soft filesystem link (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	success = ReadLink( port, lock, path, buffer, size)
	D0		     D1    D2    D3     D4     D5

	BOOL ReadLink( struct MsgPort *, BPTR, STRPTR, STRPTR, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	ReadLink() takes a lock/name pair (usually from a failed attempt
	to use them to access an object with packets), and asks the
	filesystem to find the softlink and fill buffer with the modified
	path string.  You then start the resolution process again by
	calling GetDeviceProc() with the new string from ReadLink().

	Soft-links are resolved at access time by a combination of the
	filesystem (by returning ERROR_IS_SOFT_LINK to dos), and by
	Dos (using ReadLink() to resolve any links that are hit).

   INPUTS
	port - msgport of the filesystem
	lock - lock this path is relative to on the filesystem
	path - path that caused the ERROR_IS_SOFT_LINK
	buffer - pointer to buffer for new path from handler.
	size - size of buffer.

   RESULT
	Success - boolean

   BUGS
	In V36, soft-links didn't work in the ROM filesystem.  This was
	fixed for V37.

   SYNOPSIS
	success = RemAssignList(name,lock)
	D0                  	 D1   D2

	BOOL RemAssignList(STRPTR,BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Removes an entry from a multi-directory assign.  The entry removed is
	the first one for which SameLock with 'lock' returns that they are on
	the same object.  The lock for the entry in the list is unlocked (not
	the entry passed in).

   INPUTS
	name - Name of device to remove lock from (without trailing ':')
	lock - Lock associated with the object to remove from the list

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indicator.

   BUGS
	In V36 through V39.23 dos, it would fail to remove the first lock
	in the assign.  Fixed in V39.24 dos (after the V39.106 kickstart).

	BOOL RemDosEntry(struct DosList *)

   FUNCTION
	This removes an entry from the Dos Device list.  The memory associated

	'newName' exists, Rename() fails and returns an error. Both
	'oldName' and the 'newName' can contain a directory specification.
	In this case, the file will be moved from one directory to another.

	Note: it is impossible to Rename() a file from one volume to

   FUNCTION
	This returns a packet to the process which sent it to you.  In
	addition, puts your pr_MsgPort address in dp_Port, so using ReplyPkt()
	again will send the message to you.  (This is used in "ping-ponging"

	D0                D1         D2       D3      D4

	LONG RunCommand(BPTR, ULONG, STRPTR, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	Runs a command on your process/cli.  Seglist may be any language,
	including BCPL programs.  Stacksize is in bytes.  argptr is a null-
	terminated string, argsize is its length.  Returns the returncode the
	program exited with in d0. Returns -1 if the stack couldn't be
	allocated.

	NOTE: the argument string MUST be terminated with a newline to work
	properly with ReadArgs() and other argument parsers.

	RunCommand also takes care of setting up the current input filehandle
	in such a way that ReadArgs() can be used in the program, and restores
	the state of the buffering before returning.  It also sets the value
	returned by GetArgStr(), and restores it before returning.  NOTE:
	the setting of the argument string in the filehandle was added in V37.

	It's usually appropriate to set the command name (via
	SetProgramName()) before calling RunCommand().  RunCommand() sets
	the value returned by GetArgStr() while the command is running.

   INPUTS
	seglist   - Seglist of command to run.
	stacksize - Number of bytes to allocate for stack space
	argptr    - Pointer to argument command string.
	argsize   - Number of bytes in argument command.

   SYNOPSIS
	value = SameLock(lock1, lock2)
	D0		  D1     D2

	LONG SameLock(BPTR, BPTR)

   FUNCTION
	Compares two locks.  Returns LOCK_SAME if they are on the same object,
	LOCK_SAME_VOLUME if on different objects on the same volume, and
	LOCK_DIFFERENT if they are on different volumes.  Always compare
	for equality or non-equality with the results, in case new return
	values are added.

   INPUTS
	lock1 - 1st lock for comparison
	lock2 - 2nd lock for comparison

   RESULT
	value -	LOCK_SAME, LOCK_SAME_VOLUME, or LOCK_DIFFERENT

   BUGS
	Should do more extensive checks for NULL against a real lock, checking
	to see if the real lock is a lock on the root of the boot volume.

	In V36, it would return LOCK_SAME_VOLUME for different volumes on the
	same handler.  Also, LOCK_SAME_VOLUME was LOCK_SAME_HANDLER (now

	LONG ScanStackToken(BPTR segment, LONG defaultstack)

   FUNCTION
	This function scans a segment list for the magic stack
	token, i.e. "$STACK:<size>" and adjusts the default stack
	size passed in accordingly. The return value is the maximum
	of the second argument, and all stack tokens found in the

	defaultstack -- default stack size in bytes

   RESULT
	The stack size recorded in the segment list, computed
	as the maximum of the passed in size and all stack tokens
	found in the segment list.

   NOTES
	This function uses a variant of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt

    SYNOPSIS
	oldPosition = Seek( file, position, mode )
	D0		    D1	  D2	    D3

	LONG Seek(BPTR, LONG, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	Seek() sets the read/write cursor for the file 'file' to the
	position 'position'. This position is used by both Read() and
	Write() as a place to start reading or writing. The result is the
	current absolute position in the file, or -1 if an error occurs, in
	which case IoErr() can be used to find more information. 'mode' can
	be OFFSET_BEGINNING, OFFSET_CURRENT or OFFSET_END. It is used to
	specify the relative start position. For example, 20 from current
	is a position 20 bytes forward from current, -20 is 20 bytes back
	from current.

	So that to find out where you are, seek zero from current. The end
	of the file is a Seek() positioned by zero from end. You cannot
	Seek() beyond the end of a file.

    INPUTS
	file - BCPL pointer to a file handle
	position - integer
	mode - integer

    RESULTS
	oldPosition - integer

    BUGS
	The V36 and V37 ROM filesystem (and V36/V37 l:fastfilesystem)
	returns the current position instead of -1 on an error.  It sets
	IoErr() to 0 on success, and an error code on an error.  This bug
	was fixed in the V39 filesystem.

	File System and the Fast File System, the date of the root directory
	cannot be set.  Other filesystems may not support setting the date
	for all files/directories.

   INPUTS
	name - Name of object
	date - New modification date

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure indication

   BUGS
	It is file system dependent whether SetFileDate() on an object that
	is exclusively locked proceeds without error. The FFS refuses such
	an attempt, the RAM-Handler does not.

   NAME
	SetFileSize -- Sets the size of a file (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	newsize = SetFileSize(fh, offset, mode)
	D0                    D1    D2     D3

	LONG SetFileSize(BPTR, LONG, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Changes the file size, truncating or extending as needed.  Not all
	handlers may support this; be careful and check the return code.  If
	the file is extended, no values should be assumed for the new bytes.
	If the new position would be before the filehandle's current position
	in the file, the filehandle will end with a position at the
	end-of-file.  If there are other filehandles open onto the file, the
	new size will not leave any filehandle pointing past the end-of-file.
	You can check for this by looking at the new size (which would be
	different than what you requested).

	The seek position should not be changed unless the file is made
	smaller than the current seek position.  However, see BUGS.

	Do NOT count on any specific values to be in any extended area.

   INPUTS
	fh     - File to be truncated/extended.
	offset - Offset from position determined by mode.
	mode   - One of OFFSET_BEGINNING, OFFSET_CURRENT, or OFFSET_END.

   RESULT
	newsize - position of new end-of-file or -1 for error.

   BUGS
	The RAM: filesystem releases before V47 and the normal Amiga
	filesystem act differently where the file position is left after
	SetFileSize() that extended the size of a file. Older RAM: left
	you incorrectly at the new end of the file. This has been fixed
	in the V47 RAM-Handler. The correct behaviour is to leave the
	current seek position alone, unless the new position is less
	than the current position, in which case you're left at the
	new EOF.

	The best workaround is to not make any assumptions about the seek
	position after SetFileSize().

	BOOL SetOwner (STRPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	SetOwner() sets the owner information for the file or directory.
	This value is a 32-bit value that is normally split into 16 bits
	of owner user id (bits 31-16), and 16 bits of owner group id (bits
	15-0).  However, other than returning them as shown by Examine()/
	ExNext()/ExAll(), the filesystem take no interest in the values.
	These are primarily for use by networking software (clients and
	hosts), in conjunction with the FIBF_OTR_xxx and FIBF_GRP_xxx
	protection bits.

	This entrypoint did not exist in V36, so you must open at least V37
	dos.library to use it.  V37 dos.library will return FALSE to this
	call.

    INPUTS
	name	   - pointer to a null-terminated string
	owner_info - owner uid (31:16) and group id (15:0)

    RESULTS

	BOOL SetProtection (STRPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	SetProtection() sets the protection attributes on a file or
	directory.  See <dos/dos.h> for a listing of protection bits.

	Before V36, the ROM filesystem didn't respect the Read and Write
	bits.  In V36 or later and in the FFS, the Read and Write
	bits are respected.

	The archive bit should be cleared by the filesystem whenever the file
	is changed.  Backup utilities will generally set the bit after
	backing up each file.

	The V36 Shell looks at the execute bit, and will refuse to execute
	a file if it is set. It also checks the script ('s') bit and then
	calls the Execute command on such scripts.

	Other bits are defined in the <dos/dos.h> include files.  Rather
	than referring to bits by number you should use the definitions in
	<dos/dos.h>.

    INPUTS
	name - pointer to a null-terminated string
	mask - the protection mask required

    RESULTS
	success - boolean

    NOTES
	the low order four bits, i.e. 'rwed', are low-active, i.e. a

	ASCII strings inside variables, but not required.

   INPUTS
	name   - pointer to an variable name.  Note variable names follow
		 filesystem syntax and semantics.
	buffer - a user allocated area which contains a string that is the
		 value to be associated with this variable.
	size   - length of the buffer region in bytes.  -1 means buffer
		 contains a null-terminated string.
	flags  - combination of type of var to set (low 8 bits), and
		 flags to control the behavior of this routine.  Currently
		 defined flags include:

		GVF_LOCAL_ONLY - set a local (to your process) variable.
		GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY - set a global environment variable.

		The default is to set a local environment variable.

   RESULT
	success - If non-zero, the variable was sucessfully set, FALSE
	 	  indicates failure.

   BUGS
	LV_VAR is the only type that can be global.
	Releases prior V47 did not clear the e protection bit of the
	file(s) created in ENV: and ENVARC: SetEnv did that manually.
	If a variable name contained two slashes such as //, releases
	prior to V47 would have crashed. This has been fixed.

   NAME
	SetVBuf -- set buffering modes and size (V39)

   SYNOPSIS
	error = SetVBuf(fh, buff, type, size)
	D0		D1   D2    D3    D4

	LONG SetVBuf(BPTR, STRPTR, LONG, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Changes the buffering modes and buffer size for a filehandle.
	With buff == NULL, the current buffer will be deallocated and a
	new one of (approximately) size will be allocated.  If buffer is
	non-NULL, it will be used for buffering and must be at least
	max(size,208) bytes long, and MUST be longword aligned.  If size
	is -1, then only the buffering mode will be changed.

	Note that a user-supplied buffer will not be freed if it is later
	replaced by another SetVBuf() call, nor will it be freed if the
	filehandle is closed.

	Has no effect on the buffersize of filehandles that were not created
	by AllocDosObject().

   INPUTS
	fh   - Filehandle
	buff - buffer pointer for buffered I/O or NULL.  MUST be LONG-aligned!
	type - buffering mode (see <dos/stdio.h>)
	size - size of buffer for buffered I/O (sizes less than 208 bytes
	       will be rounded up to 208), or -1.

   RESULT
	error - 0 if successful.  NOTE: opposite of most dos functions!
		NOTE: fails if someone has replaced the buffer without
		using SetVBuf() - RunCommand() does this.  Remember to
		check error before freeing user-supplied buffers!

   BUGS
	Not implemented until after V39.  From V36 up to V39, always
	returned 0.

	Changing the size of the buffer on a file opened on "NIL:" will
	lead to memory corruption and/or a crash when that file is
	closed in V36-V47.24.

	SplitName -- splits out a component of a pathname into a buffer (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	newpos = SplitName(name, separator, buf, oldpos, size)
	D0                  D1      D2      D3     D4     D5

	WORD SplitName(STRPTR, UBYTE, STRPTR, WORD, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	This routine splits out the next piece of a name from a given file
	name.  Each piece is copied into the buffer, truncating at size-1
	characters.  The new position is then returned so that it may be
	passed in to the next call to splitname.  If the separator is not
	found within 'size' characters, then size-1 characters plus a null will
	be put into the buffer, and the position of the next separator will
	be returned.

	If a a separator cannot be found, -1 is returned (but the characters
	from the old position to the end of the string are copied into the
	buffer, up to a maximum of size-1 characters).  Both strings are
	null-terminated.

	This function is mainly intended to support handlers.

   INPUTS
	name      - Filename being parsed.
	separator - Separator charactor to split by.
	buf       - Buffer to hold separated name.
	oldpos    - Current position in the file.
	size 	  - Size of buf in bytes (including null termination).

   RESULT
	newpos    - New position for next call to splitname.  -1 for last one.

   BUGS
	In V36 and V37, path portions greater than or equal to 'size' caused
	the last character of the portion to be lost when followed by a
	separator.  Fixed for V39 dos.  For V36 and V37, the suggested work-
	around is to call SplitName() with a buffer one larger than normal
	(for example, 32 bytes), and then set buf[size-2] to '0' (for example,
	buf[30] = '\0';).

	BOOL StartNotify(struct NotifyRequest *)

   FUNCTION
	Posts a notification request.  Do not modify the notify structure while
	it is active.  You will be notified when the file or directory changes.
	For files, you will be notified after the file is closed.  Not all
	filesystems will support this: applications should NOT require it.  In
	particular, most network filesystems won't support it.

   INPUTS
	notifystructure - A filled-in NotifyRequest structure

   RESULT
	success - Success/failure of request

   BUGS
	The V36 floppy/HD filesystem doesn't actually send notifications.  The
	V36 ram handler (ram:) does.  This has been fixed for V37.

   SYNOPSIS
	success = StrToDate( datetime )
	D0                      D1

	BOOL StrToDate( struct DateTime * )

   FUNCTION
	Converts a human readable text string into an AmigaDOS
	DateStamp.

   INPUTS
	DateTime - a pointer to an initialized DateTime structure.

	The DateTime structure should be initialized as follows:

	dat_Stamp - ignored on input.

	dat_Format - a format byte which specifies the format of the
		dat_StrDat.  This can be any of the following (Note:
		If the value used is something other than those below,
		the default of FORMAT_DOS will be used):

		FORMAT_DOS:	  AmigaDOS format (dd-mmm-yy).

		FORMAT_INT:	  International format (yy-mmm-dd).

		FORMAT_USA:	  American format (mm-dd-yy).

		FORMAT_CDN:	  Canadian format (dd-mm-yy).

		FORMAT_DEF:	  default format for locale.

	dat_Flags - a flags byte. The only flag which affects this
		  function is:

		DTF_FUTURE:	  If set, indicates that strings such
				  as (stored in	dat_StrDate) "Monday"
				  refer	to "next" monday. Otherwise,
				  if clear, strings like "Monday"
				  refer	to "last" monday.

		DTF_SUBST:	  Ignored by this function

	dat_StrDay - ignored by this function.

	dat_StrDate - pointer to valid string representing the date.
		  This can be a "DTF_SUBST" style string such as
		  "Today", "Tomorrow", "Monday", or it may be a string
		  as specified by the dat_Format byte. This will be
		  converted to the ds_Days portion of the DateStamp.
		  If this pointer is NULL, DateStamp->ds_Days will not
		  be affected.

	dat_StrTime - Pointer to a buffer which contains the time in
		  the text format hh:mm:ss. This will be converted
		  to the ds_Minutes and ds_Ticks portions of the
		  DateStamp. If this pointer is NULL, ds_Minutes and
		  ds_Ticks will be unchanged.

   RESULT
	success - a zero return indicates that a conversion could
		not be performed. A non-zero return indicates that the
		DateTime.dat_Stamp variable contains the converted
		values.

   NOTES
	The dat_StrDate and dat_StrTime members must either point to a
	NUL-terminated string or they must be NULL.

	The dat_Format FORMAT_DEF option will only be supported if the
	locale.library is currently active. Otherwise, FORMAT_DOS will
	be used instead which can lead to conversion errors.

   FUNCTION
	Converts decimal string into LONG value.  Returns number of characters
	converted.  Skips over leading spaces & tabs (included in count).  If
	no decimal digits are found (after skipping leading spaces & tabs),
	StrToLong returns -1 for characters converted, and puts 0 into value.

   INPUTS
	string - Input string.
	value  - Pointer to long value.  Set to 0 if no digits are converted.

   RESULT
	result - Number of characters converted or -1.

   BUGS
	Before V39, if there were no convertible characters it returned the
	number of leading white-space characters (space and tab in this case).

   SYNOPSIS
	error = SystemTagList(command, tags)
	D0		        D1      D2 

	LONG SystemTagList(STRPTR, struct TagItem *)

	error = System(command, tags)
	D0		 D1      D2 

	LONG System(STRPTR, struct TagItem *)

	error = SystemTags(command, Tag1, ...)

	LONG SystemTags(STRPTR, ULONG, ...)

   FUNCTION
	Similar to Execute(), creates a new shell in various ways. Spawns
	a Shell process to execute the command. Depending on its arguments,
	may or may not wait for the command(s) to be completed. If it does
	wait, returns the return code of the command, or returns 0 for
	success in all cases, or -1 if the command(s) could not be run for
	any reason.

	If System() waits for completion, the input and output filehandles
	will not be closed by System, you must close them (if needed) after
	System returns if you specified them via SYS_Input or SYS_Output.
	The command stream SYS_Command/SYS_CmdName will always be closed on
	success, regardless of other arguments.

	By default the new process will use your current Input() and Output()
	filehandles.  Normal Shell command-line parsing will be done
	including redirection on 'command'.  The current directory and path
	will be inherited from your process.  Your path will be used to find
	the command if no path is specified.

	Note that you may NOT pass the same filehandle for both SYS_Input
	and SYS_Output.  If you want input and output to both be to the same
	CON: window, pass a SYS_Input of a filehandle on the CON: window,
	and pass a SYS_Output of NULL.  The shell will automatically set
	the default Output() stream to the window you passed via SYS_Input,
	by opening "*" on that handler, or "NIL:" if "*" could not be
	opened.

	If used with the SYS_Asynch flag, it WILL close both its input and
	output filehandles after running the command (even if these were
	your Input() and Output()!).

	If command is NULL, System() will read from SYS_CmdStream, or
	SYS_Input if the former is not given. It will return immediately
	and execute such commands in background, even without SYS_Asynch
	set. (V40) This mode is used to implement RUN, see NOTES below. 

	SYS_Asynch can also be set along with a command or a SYS_CmdStream.
	In such a case, the shell will execute the commands from SYS_CmdStream
	or command asynchronously, and after its depletion, will contine to
	read commands interactively from the input file handle. (V47)
	This mode is used to implement the NEWSHELL command, see NOTES.

	Normally uses the boot (ROM) shell, but other shells can be specified
	via SYS_UserShell and SYS_CustomShell.  Normally, you should send
	things written by the user to the UserShell.  The UserShell defaults
	to the same shell as the boot shell.

	The tags are passed through to CreateNewProc(), tags that conflict
	with SystemTagList() will be filtered out. This allows setting
	things like priority, etc for the new process.  The tags that are
	currently filtered out are:

		NP_Seglist
		NP_FreeSeglist
		NP_Entry
		NP_Input
		NP_Output
		NP_Error
		NP_CloseInput
		NP_CloseOutput
		NP_CloseError
		NP_HomeDir
		NP_Cli

   INPUTS
	command - Program and arguments or NULL.
		  In case command is NULL, a new shell will be started that
		  reads commands from SYS_CmdStream or SYS_CmdIn (if supplied)
		  followed by SYS_Input or SYS_InName, until both sources are
		  exhausted. See below for interaction with SYS_Asynch.
		  

	tags    - see <dos/dostags.h>.  Note that both SystemTagList()-
		  specific tags and tags from CreateNewProc() may be passed.

	SYS_Input:	The input stream the shell will receive. This stream
			will go into cli_StandardInput of the shell and will
			by that also become the input stream of the command
			if one is supplied. If command is NULL and
			SYS_CmdStream/CmdName is not supplied, commands are
			read from SYS_Input/InName instead. Default is the
			input stream of the caller. (BPTR)
	SYS_InName:	A file name that will be opened to supply an input
			stream. This is mutually exclusive to SYS_Input and
			overrides it if present. The input file will be closed
			when the command or shell returns. (const UBYTE *,V47)
	SYS_Output:	The output stream of the shell to be created. This
			stream will go into cli_StandardOutput of the shell
			and will by that also become the output stream of
			the command if one is supplied. Default is the output
			stream of the caller. If this is NULL, System()
			will instead use Open("*",MODE_NEWFILE) as output from
			the handler responsible for SYS_Input if this stream
			is interactive. Otherwise, or if "*" could not be
			opened, output will go to "NIL:". (BPTR)
	SYS_OutName:	A file name that will be opened to supply an output
			stream. This is mutually exclusive to SYS_Output. The
			file will be closed on exit. (const UBYTE *,V47)
	SYS_CmdStream:	Mutually exclusive to the command argument. If command
			is NULL, then the shell will instead read commands from
			this stream until it depletes. If SYS_Asynch is also set,
			then the shell will continue reading from SYS_Input.
			The default is NULL in which case the command to be
			executed comes either from command or SYS_Input or
			SYS_InCmd. The CmdStream is always closed on
			exit, even if it is your stream. (BPTR,V47)
	SYS_CmdName:	A file name that will be openend to supply the command
			stream. This is mutually exclusive to SYS_CmdStream.
			The stream will be closed on exit. (BPTR,V47)
	SYS_Asynch:	Start the new shell in the background and return
			immediately. This is implicit if command is NULL and
			SYS_CmdStream is not supplied. This also implies that
			all streams will be closed by the shell/command once
			it returns, and NP_CurrentDir will be unlocked.
	SYS_UserShell:	Starts the user shell, i.e. "Shell" on the resident
			list instead of the system Boot CLI.
	SYS_CustomShell:Starts a custom shell from the resident list. The
			argument is a name of a resident module.

   RESULT
	error	- 0 for success, result from command, or -1.  Note that on
		  error, the caller is responsible for any filehandles or
		  other things passed in via tags.  -1 will only be returned
		  if dos could not create the new shell.  If the command is
		  not found the shell will return an error value, normally
		  RETURN_ERROR.
		  If System() runs a shell or command asynchronously, the
		  result code is either 0 for success, or -1 in case the
		  shell or command(s) could not be launched.

    NOTES
	This call requires (as of V47) about 800 bytes stack space, and
	needs the caller to be a Process. There is no automatic stack
	extension.
  
	The RUN command is equivalent to

	System(NULL,SYS_Input,instream,SYS_Output,Output(),
	       SYS_UserShell,TRUE,TAG_DONE);

	where instream is a stream that delivers the command to be run.
	For historical reasons, SYS_Async is implicitly set by System(),
	even if not given, and the command is passed in through a faked
	stream, not as first argument, see also BUGS below.


	The NEWSHELL command is equivalent to

	System(NULL,SYS_InName,"CON:...",
	       SYS_CmdStream,Open("S:Shell-Startup",MODE_OLDFILE),
	       SYS_Asynch,TRUE,SYS_UserShell,TRUE,
	       NP_Name,"Shell Process",TAG_DONE);

	While V47 goes through System(), previous releases of NewShell
	used an undocumented legacy shell startup mechanism that has
	been deprecated.

	The Execute() system call is roughly equivalent to

	System(NULL,SYS_CmdStream,cmd,
	       SYS_Input,in,SYS_Output,out,SYS_UserShell,FALSE,
	       NP_Priority,0,TAG_DONE);

	where cmd is a stream that delivers the command otherwise
	given as first argument to Execute(), and except that
	Execute() returns DOSTRUE in case System() would return 0.

   BUGS
	V45 and before could release SYS_Input in some error cases.
	This is fixed in V47 where System() either returns the command
	return code, or -1, and does not release caller resources in the
	latter case.

	In case the function returned -1 to indicate failure, any lock
	passed in as NP_CurrentDir was released by V45 and before, even
	though the docs stated and still state that the caller is
	responsible for releasing it on error. This also got fixed in V47.
	Note that in case of success, NP_CurrenDir is passed over to the
	shell/command created, and is released there - this is as documented
	and not a bug.

	NP_Name was not honoured. Instead, the new shell always received the
	name "Background CLI", even with NP_Name set. V47 fixes this.

	If command is NULL, System() always detaches the shell it creates
	and does not wait for its completion, even if SYS_Async is FALSE.
	V47 retains this behaviour for compatibility reasons. The shell
	created this way is non-interactive, signal-handling is not
	forwarded to the shell, and the console port remains unset, i.e.
	the configuration is as required for the Run command which uses
	such parameters, see NOTES above. To create an interactive shell,
	set SYS_Asynch to TRUE explicitly.

	In case command is NULL and an command and input stream coincide,
	System() prints the CLI number of the created shell in brackets
	over the output stream as these arguments also reflect the Run
	command. This should be again better implemented in the Run and not
	in the System() call, but also remains as such for compatibility.

	V45 and below did not clearly document that System() can (obviously)
	not return a command result code in asynchronous operations.

   NAME
	UnGetC -- Makes a char available for reading again. (buffered) (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	value = UnGetC(fh, character)
	D0	       D1      D2

	LONG UnGetC(BPTR, LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Pushes the character specified back into the input buffer.  Every
	time you use a buffered read routine, you can always push back 1
	character.  You may be able to push back more, though it is not
	recommended, since there is no guarantee on how many can be
	pushed back at a given moment.

	Passing -1 for the character will cause the last character read to
	be pushed back.  If the last character read was an EOF, the next
	character read will be an EOF.

	Note: UnGetC can be used to make sure that a filehandle is set up
	as a read filehandle.  This is only of importance if you are writing
	a shell, and must manipulate the filehandle's buffer.

   INPUTS
	fh	  - filehandle to use for buffered I/O
	character - character to push back or -1

   RESULT
	value     - character pushed back, or FALSE if the character cannot
		    be pushed back.

   BUGS
	In V36, UnGetC(fh,-1) after an EOF would not cause the next character
	read to be an EOF.  This was fixed for V37.

    NAME
	UnLoadSeg -- Unload a seglist previously loaded by LoadSeg()

    SYNOPSIS
	success = UnLoadSeg( seglist )
	D0		       D1

	BOOL UnLoadSeg(BPTR)

    FUNCTION
	Unload a seglist loaded by LoadSeg().  'seglist' may be zero.
	Overlaid segments will have all needed cleanup done, including
	closing files.

    INPUTS
	seglist - BCPL pointer to a segment identifier

    RESULTS
	success - returns 0 if a NULL seglist was passed or if it failed
		  to close an overlay file.  NOTE: this function returned
		  a random value before V36!

    NOTES
	In case the segment contains at offset 8 the magic long word
	$ABCD, and the fourth long word after this identifier coincides
	with the global vector of the dos.library, the segment is
	identified as an overlay segment. UnLoadSeg() then releases addition
	resources such as the file handle for overlay management.

    INPUTS
	lock - BCPL pointer to a lock

    NOTE
	Passing zero to UnLock() is harmless.

   SYNOPSIS
	success = UnLockRecord(fh,offset,length)
	D0		       D1   D2     D3

	BOOL UnLockRecord(BPTR,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
	This releases the specified lock on a file.  Note that you must use

	BOOL UnLockRecords(struct RecordLock *)

   FUNCTION
	This releases an array of record locks obtained using LockRecords.
	You should NOT modify the record_array while you have the records
	locked.  Every LockRecords() call must be balanced with an

	LONG VFPrintf(BPTR, STRPTR, LONG *)

	count = FPrintf(fh, fmt, ...)

	LONG FPrintf(BPTR, STRPTR, ...)

   FUNCTION
	Writes the formatted string and values to the given file.  This
	routine is assumed to handle all internal buffering so that the
	formatting string and resultant formatted values can be arbitrarily
	long.  Any secondary error code is returned in IoErr().  This routine
	is buffered.

   INPUTS
	fh    - Filehandle to write to
	fmt   - RawDoFmt() style formatting string
	argv  - Pointer to array of formatting values

   RESULT
	count - Number of bytes written or -1 (EOF) for an error

   BUGS
	The prototype for FPrintf() forced you in V40 to cast the first
	varargs parameter to LONG due to a deficiency in the program
	that generates fds, prototypes, and amiga.lib stubs. This was
	fixed in V44.

   FUNCTION
	Writes the formatted string and values to the specified file.  This
	routine is assumed to handle all internal buffering so that the
	formatting string and resultant formatted values can be arbitrarily
	long.  The formats are in BCPL form.  This routine is buffered.

	Supported formats are:  (Note x is in base 36!)
		%S  - string (CSTR)
		%Tx - writes a left-justified string in a field at least
		      x bytes long.
		%C  - writes a single character
		%Ox - writes a number in octal, maximum x characters wide
		%Xx - writes a number in hex, maximum x characters wide
		%Ix - writes a number in decimal, maximum x characters wide
		%N  - writes a number in decimal, any length
		%Ux - writes an unsigned number, maximum x characters wide
		%$  - ignore parameter

	Note: 'x' above is actually the character value - '0'.

   INPUTS
	fh    - filehandle to write to
	fmt   - BCPL style formatting string
	argv  - Pointer to array of formatting values

   RESULT
	count - Number of bytes written or -1 for error

   BUGS
	As of V37, VFWritef() does NOT return a valid return value.  In

	VolumeRequestHook -- Request insertion of a volume (V47)

   SYNOPSIS
	res = VolumeRequestHook(volume)
	D0			  D1

	LONG VolumeRequestHook(UBYTE *volume)

   FUNCTION
	This function is called by the dos.library itself in case a
	program attempts to access a volume that is currently not
	mounted or not inserted. By default, this call returns -1,
	indicating that the dos.library should show its default
	requester, i.e. "Please insert volume...".
	The name of the requested volume is provided as argument.
	A user supplied application may replace this function and
	thus provide a more elaborate requester.

   INPUTS
	A NUL terminated C string without terminating colon.

   RESULT
	Returns -1 in case the default dos.library volume requester
	should be shown.
	Returns 0 in case the insertion shall be aborted, i.e.
	canceled the request.
	Returns 1 in case the access shall be retried.

	Writes the formatted string and values to Output().  This routine is 
	assumed to handle all internal buffering so that the formatting string
	and resultant formatted values can be arbitrarily long.  Any secondary
	error code is returned in IoErr().  This routine is buffered.

	Note: RawDoFmt assumes 16 bit ints, so you will usually need 'l's in

    SYNOPSIS
	status = WaitForChar( file, timeout )
	D0		      D1    D2

	BOOL WaitForChar(BPTR, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	If a character is available to be read from 'file' within the
	time (in microseconds) indicated by 'timeout', WaitForChar()
	returns -1 (TRUE). If a character is available, you can use Read()
	to read it.  Note that WaitForChar() is only valid when the I/O
	stream is connected to a virtual terminal device. If a character is
	not available within 'timeout', a 0 (FALSE) is returned.

    BUGS
	Due to a bug in the timer.device in V1.2/V1.3, specifying a timeout
	of zero for WaitForChar() can cause the unreliable timer & floppy
	disk operation.

	D0			 D1    D2      D3

	LONG Write (BPTR, void *, LONG)

    FUNCTION
	Write() writes bytes of data to the opened file 'file'. 'length'
	indicates the length of data to be transferred; 'buffer' is a
	pointer to the buffer. The value returned is the length of
	information actually written. So, when 'length' is greater than
	zero, the value of 'length' is the number of characters written.
	Errors are indicated by a value of -1.

	Note: this is an unbuffered routine, i.e the request is passed
	directly to the filesystem.  Buffered I/O is more efficient for
	small reads and writes; see FPutC().
