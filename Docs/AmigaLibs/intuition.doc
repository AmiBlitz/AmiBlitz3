    NAME
	ActivateGadget -- Activate a (string or custom) gadget.

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = ActivateGadget( Gadget, Window, Request )
	D0			  A0      A1      A2

	BOOL ActivateGadget( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester * );

    FUNCTION
	Activates a string or custom gadget.  If successful, this means
	that the user does not need to click in the gadget before typing.

	The window parameter must point to the window which contains the gadget.
	If the gadget is actually in a requester, the window must contain
	the requester, and a pointer to the requester must also be
	passed.	The requester parameter must only be valid if the gadget
	has the	GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, a requirement for all requester
	gadgets.

	The success of this function depends on a rather complex set
	of conditions.  The intent is that the user is never interrupted from
	what interactions he may have underway.

	The current set of conditions includes:
	-   The window must be active.  If you are opening a new window
	    and want an active gadget in it, it is not sufficient to
	    assume that the WFLG_ACTIVATE flag has taken effect by the time
	    OpenWindow() returns, even if you insert a delay of some
	    finite amount of time.  Use the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW IntuiMessage
	    to tell when your window really becomes active.  Many
	    programs use an event loop that calls ActivateGadget()
	    whenever they receive the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW message, and also
	    the IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS messages, and so on, to keep the
	    gadget active until it is used (or the user selects some
	    other "Cancel" gadget).

	-   No other gadgets may be in use.  This includes system gadgets,
	    such as those for window sizing, dragging, etc.
	-   If the gadget is in a requester, that requester must
	    be active. (Use IDCMP_REQSET and IDCMP_REQCLEAR).
	-   The right mouse button cannot be held down (e.g. menus)

	NOTE: Don't try to activate a gadget which is disabled or
	not attached to a window or requester.

    INPUTS
	Gadget = pointer to the gadget that you want activated.
	Window = pointer to a window structure containing the gadget.
	Requester = pointer to a requester (may by NULL if this isn't 
           a requester gadget (i.e. GTYP_REQGADGET is not set)).

    RESULT
	If the conditions above are met, and the gadget is in fact a string
	gadget, then this function will return TRUE, else FALSE.

    BUGS
	At present, this function will not return FALSE if a custom
	gadget declines to be activated.

    NAME
	ActivateWindow -- Activate an Intuition window.

    SYNOPSIS
	ActivateWindow( Window )
	                A0

	VOID ActivateWindow( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Activates an Intuition window. 

	Note that this call may have its action deferred: you cannot assume
	that when this call is made the selected window has become active. 
	This action will be postponed while the user plays with gadgets and
	menus, or sizes and drags windows.  You may detect when the window
	actually has become active by the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW IDCMP message.

	This call is intended to provide flexibility but not to confuse the
	user.  Please call this function synchronously with some action
	by the user.

    INPUTS
	Window = a pointer to a Window structure

    RESULT
	None.

    BUGS
	Some versions of the documentation claimed that this function
	had a meaningful return value under V36 and higher.  That is
	not true.

	Calling this function in a tight loop can blow out Intuition's
	deferred action queue.

	OpenWindow(), and the WFLG_ACTIVATE window flag
intuition.library/AddClass                         intuition.library/AddClass

    NAME
	AddClass -- Make a public class available (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	AddClass( Class )
	          A0

	VOID AddClass( struct IClass * );

    FUNCTION
	Adds a public boopsi class to the internal list of classes available
	for public consumption.
	
	You must call this function after you call MakeClass().

    INPUTS
	Class = pointer returned by MakeClass()

    RESULT
	Nothing returned.
	
    NOTES

    BUGS
	Although there is some protection against creating classes
	with the same name as an existing class, this function
	does not do any checking or other dealings with like-named
	classes.  Until this is rectified, only officially registered
	names can be used for public classes, and there is no
	"class replacement" policy in effect.

	and the "boopsi Class Reference" document.
intuition.library/AddGadget                       intuition.library/AddGadget

    NAME
	AddGadget -- Add a gadget to the gadget list of a window.

    SYNOPSIS
	RealPosition = AddGadget( Window, Gadget, Position )
	D0			  A0      A1      D0

	UWORD  AddGadget( struct Window *, struct Gadget *, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	Adds the specified gadget to the gadget list of the given window,
	linked in at the position in the list specified by the position 
	argument (that is, if Position == 0, the gadget will be inserted
	at the head of the list, and if Position == 1 then the gadget will
	be inserted after the first gadget and before the second).  If the
	position you specify is greater than the number of gadgets in the
	list, your gadget will be added to the end of the list.
	
	Calling AddGadget() does not cause your gadget to be redisplayed.
	The benefit of this is that you may add several gadgets without
	having the gadget list redrawn every time.

	This procedure returns the position at which your gadget was added.
   
	NOTE:  A relatively safe way to add the gadget to the end of the 
	list is to specify a position of -1 (i.e., (UWORD) ~0).  That way,
	only the 65536th (and multiples of it) will be inserted at the wrong
	position.  The return value of the procedure will tell you where it was 
	actually inserted.

	NOTE:  The system window gadgets are initially added to the
	front of the gadget list.  The reason for this is:  If you position
	your own gadgets in some way that interferes with the graphical
	representation of the system gadgets, the system's ones will be "hit"
	first by user.  If you then start adding gadgets to the front of the
	list, you will disturb this plan, so beware.  On the other hand, if
	you don't violate the design rule of never overlapping your gadgets,
	there's no problem.  

	NOTE:  You may not add your own gadgets to a screen.  Gadgets may
	be added to backdrop windows, however, which can be visually similar,
	but also provide an IDCMP channel for gadget input messages.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window to get your gadget
	Gadget = pointer to the new gadget
	Position = integer position in the list for the new gadget (starting
	    from zero as the first position in the list)

    RESULT
	Returns the position of where the gadget was actually added.

    NAME
	AddGList -- Add a linked list of gadgets to a window or requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	RealPosition = AddGList( Window, Gadget, Position, Numgad, Requester )
	D0                       A0      A1      D0        D1      A2

	UWORD AddGList( struct Window *, struct Gadget *, UWORD, WORD,
		struct Requester * );
	
    FUNCTION
	Adds the list of gadgets to the gadget list of the given window
	or requester linked in at the position in the list specified by
	the position argument. 

	See AddGadget() for more information about gadget list position,
	and more information about gadgets in general.

	The requester parameter will be ignored unless the GTYP_REQGADGET
	bit is set in the GadgetType field of the first gadget in the list.
	In that case, the gadget list is added to the requester gadgets.
	NOTE: be sure that GTYP_REQGADGET is either set or cleared consistently
	for all gadgets in the list.  NOTE ALSO: The window parameter
	should point to the window that the requester (will) appear in.

	Will add 'Numgad' gadgets from gadget list linked by the field
	NextGadget, or until some NextGadget field is found to be NULL.  Does
	not assume that the Numgad'th gadget has NextGadget equal to NULL.

	NOTE WELL: In order to link your gadget list in, the NextGadget
	field of the Numgad'th (or last) gadget will be modified.  Thus, if 
	you are adding the first 3 gadgets from a linked list of five gadgets,
	this call will sever the connection between your third and fourth
	gadgets.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window to get your gadget
	Gadget = pointer to the first gadget to be added
	Position = integer position in the list for the new gadget
	    (starting from zero as the first position in the list)
	Numgad = the number of gadgets from the linked list to be added
	    if Numgad equals -1, the entire null-terminated list of
	    gadgets will be added.
	Requester = the requester the gadgets will be added to if the
	    GTYP_REQGADGET GadgetType flag is set for the first gadget
	    in the list

    RESULT
	Returns the position of where the first gadget in the list was actually
	added.

intuition.library/AllocRemember               intuition.library/AllocRemember

    NAME
	AllocRemember -- AllocMem() with tracking to make freeing easy.

    SYNOPSIS
	MemBlock = AllocRemember( RememberKey, Size, Flags )
	D0			  A0	       D0    D1
	
	APTR AllocRemember( struct Remember **, ULONG, ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	This routine calls the Exec AllocMem() function for you, but also links
	the parameters of the allocation into a master list, so that
	you can simply call the Intuition routine FreeRemember() at a later 
	time to deallocate all allocated memory without being required to
	remember the details of the memory you've allocated.

	This routine will have two primary uses:
       -   Let's say that you're doing a long series of allocations in a 
           procedure.  If any one of the allocations fails, your program
	    may need to abort the procedure.  Abandoning ship correctly
	    involves freeing up what memory you've already allocated.  This
	    procedure allows you to free up that memory easily, without being
	    required to keep track of how many allocations you've already done,
	    what the sizes of the allocations were, or where the memory was
	    allocated.

       -   Also, in the more general case, you may do all of the allocations 
           in your entire program using this routine.  Then, when your 
           program is exiting, you can free it all up at once with a 
           simple call to FreeRemember().

	You create the "anchor" for the allocation master list by creating 
	a variable that's a pointer to struct Remember, and initializing 
	that pointer to NULL.  This is called the RememberKey.  Whenever 
	you call AllocRemember(), the routine actually does two memory 
	allocations, one for the memory you want and the other for a copy 
	of a Remember structure.  The Remember structure is filled in 
	with data describing your memory allocation, and it's linked 
	into the master list pointed to by your RememberKey.  Then, to 
	free up any memory that's been allocated, all you have to do is 
	call FreeRemember() with your RememberKey.

	Please read the FreeRemember() function description, too.  As you will
	see, you can select either to free just the link nodes and keep all the 
	allocated memory for yourself, or to free both the nodes and your memory
	buffers.


    INPUTS
	RememberKey = the address of a pointer to struct Remember.  Before the
	very first call to AllocRemember, initialize this pointer to NULL. 

	Size = the size in bytes of the memory allocation.  Please refer to the
	    exec.library/AllocMem() function for details.
	Flags = the specifications for the memory allocation.  Please refer to 
	    the exec.library/AllocMem() function for details.

    EXAMPLE
	struct Remember *RememberKey;
	RememberKey = NULL;
	buffer = AllocRemember(&RememberKey, BUFSIZE, MEMF_CHIP);
	if (buffer)
	{
	    /* Use the buffer */
	    ...
	}
	FreeRemember(&RememberKey, TRUE);

    RESULT
	If the memory allocation is successful, this routine returns the byte 
	address of your requested memory block.  Also, the node to your block 
	will be linked into the list pointed to by your RememberKey variable.
	If the allocation fails, this routine returns NULL and the list pointed
	to by RememberKey, if any, will be unchanged.

    BUGS
	This function makes two allocations for each memory buffer
	you request.  This is neither fast nor good for memory
	fragmentation.

	This function should use the exec AllocPool() function internally,
	at least for the Remember headers.

intuition.library/AllocScreenBuffer       intuition.library/AllocScreenBuffer

    NAME
	AllocScreenBuffer -- Get a ScreenBuffer for double-buffering. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	sbuffer = AllocScreenBuffer( Screen, BitMap, flags )
	D0                           A0      A1      D0

	struct ScreenBuffer *AllocScreenBuffer( struct Screen *,
	    struct BitMap *, ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	Allocates a ScreenBuffer structure and usually a BitMap.  This
	structure can be used for double (or multiple) buffering in
	Intuition screens.  You may use this call to obtain a ScreenBuffer
	structure for the screen's initial BitMap, or for other BitMaps
	you intend to swap in.

	AllocScreenBuffer() also allocates a graphics.library DBufInfo
	structure.  The ScreenBuffer structure this call returns contains
	a pointer to that DBufInfo structure, which is free for your use.
	See graphics.library/AllocDBufInfo() for full details on using
	this structure to achieve notification of when it is safe to
	render into an old buffer and when it is right to switch again.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to the screen to double-buffer
	BitMap = For CUSTOMBITMAP screens, you may pre-allocate
		a BitMap matching the screen's BitMap's properties, and
		pass that in, to get a ScreenBuffer referring to that
		BitMap.  Set this parameter to NULL if you'd prefer
		that Intuition allocate the alternate buffer.  This parameter
		must be NULL for non-CUSTOMBITMAP screens.
	Flags = Set a combination of these flags:
	    For non-CUSTOMBITMAP screens, set SB_SCREEN_BITMAP in order to
		get a ScreenBuffer referring to the screen's actual BitMap.
		(For CUSTOMBITMAP screens, just set the BitMap parameter
		to the BitMap you passed to OpenScreen()).
	    Set SB_COPY_BITMAP if you would like the screen's BitMap
		copied into this ScreenBuffer's BitMap.  This is required
		to get any menu-bar or gadget imagery into each
		ScreenBuffer's BitMap.  If the screen has no Intuition
		rendering, you may omit this flag.  Also, when allocating
		a ScreenBuffer for the screen's initial BitMap, this flag
		should not be set.

    RESULT
	Pointer to a valid ScreenBuffer structure, or NULL if failure.
	You may render into the resulting BitMap as appropriate.
	You may use the sb_DBufInfo field to access graphics.library
	ViewPort-buffering features such as learning when it is safe
	to reuse the previous BitMap.  If not, you risk writing into
	the on-screen BitMap, which can damage menu or gadget rendering!

    NOTES

	The role of SB_SCREEN_BITMAP is to wrap a ScreenBuffer around
	the actual current BitMap used by the non-CUSTOMBITMAP screen.
	The words actual or current are used instead of initial, since
	an application could do some double-buffering, leave the
	non-initial buffer installed into the screen, free up the
	others, then re-allocate ScreenBuffer structures to do more
	double-buffering.  In that case, the actual screen BitMap is
	not necessarily the initial one.

	The role of SB_COPY_BITMAP is to say "please put whatever
	imagery is currently on-screen into this new BitMap too".
	That's how the screen titlebar and other imagery get copied
	over into each buffer.

intuition.library/AutoRequest                   intuition.library/AutoRequest

    NAME
	AutoRequest -- Automatically build and get response from a requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	Response = AutoRequest( Window, BodyText, PosText, NegText, 
	D0                      A0      A1        A2       A3
			PosFlags, NegFlags, Width, Height )
			D0        D1        D2     D3

	BOOL AutoRequest( struct Window *, struct IntuiText *,
		struct IntuiText *, struct IntuiText *, 
		ULONG, ULONG, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	This procedure automatically builds a requester for you and then 
	waits for a response from the user, or for the system to satisfy your 
	request.  If the response is positive, this procedure returns TRUE.  
	If the response is negative, this procedure returns FALSE.  

	An IDCMPFlag specification is created by bitwise "or'ing" your
	PosFlags, NegFlags, and the IDCMP classes IDCMP_GADGETUP and
	IDCMP_RAWKEY.  You may specify zero flags for either the PosFlags
	or NegFlags arguments.  

	The IntuiText arguments, and the width and height values, are 
	passed directly to the BuildSysRequest() procedure along with 
	your window pointer and the IDCMP flags.  Please refer to 
	BuildSysRequest() for a description of the IntuiText that you are 
	expected to supply when calling this routine.  It's an important
	but long-winded description that need not be duplicated here.  

	If the BuildSysRequest() procedure does not return a pointer 
	to a window, it will return TRUE or FALSE (not valid structure 
	pointers) instead, and these BOOL values will be returned to 
	you immediately.  

	On the other hand, if a valid window pointer is returned, that 
	window will have had its IDCMP ports and flags initialized according 
	to your specifications.  AutoRequest() then waits for IDCMP messages 
	on the UserPort, which satisfies one of four requirements:
	-   either the message is of a class that matches 
	    one of your PosFlags arguments (if you've supplied 
	    any), in which case this routine returns TRUE.  Or
	-   the message class matches one of your NegFlags 
	    arguments (if you've supplied any), in which case 
	    this routine returns FALSE.  Or
	-   the IDCMP message is of class IDCMP_GADGETUP, which means that
	    one of the two gadgets, as provided with the PosText and NegText 
	    arguments, was selected by the user.  If the TRUE gadget 
	    was selected, TRUE is returned.  If the FALSE gadget was 
	    selected, FALSE is returned.  
	-   Lastly, two IDCMP_RAWKEY messages may satisfy the request: those
	    for the V and B keys with the left Amiga key depressed.
	    These keys, satisfy the gadgets on the left or right side of
	    the requester--TRUE or FALSE--, respectively.

	    NOTE: For V36, these two keys left-Amiga-B and V are processed
	    through the default keymap.

	When the dust has settled, this routine calls FreeSysRequest() if
	necessary to clean up the requester and any other allocated memory.

	NOTE: For V36, this function now switches the processor stack
	to ensure sufficient stack space for the function to succeed.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure.  See BuildSysRequest()
	    for a full discussion.
	BodyText = pointer to an IntuiText structure
	PosText = pointer to an IntuiText structure, may by NULL.
	NegText = pointer to an IntuiText structure, MUST be valid!
	PosFlags = flags for the IDCMP
	NegFlags = flags for the IDCMP
	Width, Height = the sizes to be used for the rendering of the requester 

	NOTE for V36: The width and height parameters are ignored, as
	are several other specifications in the IntuiText, to make
	AutoRequest() requesters retroactively conform to the new look
	designed for EasyRequest().

    RESULT
	The return value is either TRUE or FALSE.  See the text above for a 
	complete description of the chain of events that might lead to either
	of these values being returned.

    NOTES
	When DOS brings up AutoRequests() on your process (eg.
	"Please insert volume XXX in any drive", they normally come
	up on the Workbench screen.  If you set your Process pr_WindowPtr
	field to point to one of your windows, then DOS will bring its
	requesters up on the same screen as that window.  A pr_WindowPtr
	of -1 prevents requesters from coming up at all.
	(Some FileSystem requesters cannot be redirected or supressed).

    BUGS
	The requester no longer devolves into a call to DisplayAlert()
	if there is not enough memory for the requester.

intuition.library/BeginRefresh                 intuition.library/BeginRefresh

    NAME
	BeginRefresh -- Sets up a window for optimized refreshing.

    SYNOPSIS
	BeginRefresh( Window )
		      A0

	VOID BeginRefresh( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	This routine sets up your window for optimized refreshing.  

	Its role is to provide Intuition integrated access to the Layers
	library function BeginUpdate().  Its additional contribution is
	to be sure that locking protocols for layers are followed, by
	locking both layers of a WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO window only after the
	parent Layer_Info has been locked.  Also, the WFLG_WINDOWREFRESH
	flag is set in your window, for your information.

	The purpose of BeginUpdate(), and hence BeginRefresh(), is to 
	restrict rendering in a window (layer) to the region that needs
	refreshing after an operation such as window sizing or uncovering. 
	This restriction to the "damage region" persists until you call
	EndRefresh().
	
	For instance, if you have a WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH window which is
	partially concealed and the user brings it to the front, you can
	receive an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message asking you to refresh your
	display.  If you call BeginRefresh() before doing any of the
	rendering, then the layer that underlies your window will be arranged
	so that the only rendering that will actually take place will be that
	which goes to the newly-revealed areas.  This is very performance-
	efficient, and visually attractive.

	After you have performed your refresh of the display, you should call
	EndRefresh() to reset the state of the layer and the window.  Then you
	may proceed with rendering to the entire window as usual.

	You learn that your window needs refreshing by receiving either a
	message of class IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW through the IDCMP, or an input
	event of class IECLASS_REFRESHWINDOW through the Console device.
	Whenever you are told that your window needs refreshing, you should
	call BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh() to clear the refresh-needed
	state, even if you don't plan on doing any rendering.  You may relieve
	yourself of even this burden by setting the WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH flag
	when opening your window.

    NOTES
	WARNING: You should only perform simple graphics refreshing
	operations between BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh().  These include
	any graphics.library drawing functions or the simple Intuition
	rendering functions (DrawImage(), PrintIText(), DrawBorder(), and
	so on).  In particular, do not call RefreshGadgets(), RefreshGList(),
	RefreshWindowFrame(), etc., since any of the complex Intuition
	functions run the risk of creating a deadlock.  Also avoid any
	other high-level calls in Intuition or ones that might invoke
	Intuition.  This means no calling SetPointer(), no calling
	LockIBase(), no dos.library functions (since an EasyRequest()
	might result), etc.  Keep it simple.

	By the time the application receives its IDCMP_REFRESHWINDWOW
	message, Intuition has already repaired any damaged regions
	of the window border or the gadgets in the window, so attempts
	to redraw gadgets or borders are as unnecessary as they are
	dangerous.

	ANOTHER WARNING: The concept of multiple refresh passes using
	EndRefresh( w, FALSE ) is not completely sound without further
	protection.  The reason is that between two sessions, more
	damage can occur to your window.  Your final EndRefresh( w, TRUE )
	will dispose of all damage, including the new, and your
	initial refreshing pass will never get the chance to refresh
	the new damage.

	To avoid this, you must protect your session using LockLayerInfo()
	which will prevent Intuition from performing window operations
	or anything else which might cause further damage from occurring.
	Again, while holding the LayerInfo lock make no Intuition
	function calls dealing with gadgets; just render.

	You can, however, call InstallClipRegion() for the different
	refresh passes, if you have two clip regions.

	SIMILAR WARNING: Your program and Intuition "share" your window
	layer's DamageList.  BeginRefresh() helps arbitrate this
	sharing, but the lower-level function layers.library/BeginUpdate()
	does not.  It isn't really supported to use BeginUpdate() on
	a window's layer, but if you do--for whatever reason--it is
	critical that you first acquire the LayerInfo lock as in
	the above example: even if you only have one pass of refresh
	rendering to do.  Otherwise, the refreshing of your window's
	borders and gadgets can be incomplete, and the problem might
	occur only under certain conditions of task priority and
	system load.

    EXAMPLE
	Code fragment for "two pass" window refreshing, in response
	to an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message:
	switch ( imsg->Class )
	{
	...
	case IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW:
	    window = imsg->IDCMPWindow;

	    /* this lock only needed for "two-pass" refreshing */
	    LockLayerInfo( &window->WScreen->LayerInfo );

	    /* refresh pass for region 1 */
	    origclip = InstallClipRegion( window->WLayer, region1 );
	    BeginRefresh( window );
	    myRefreshRegion1( window );
	    EndRefresh( window, FALSE );

	    /* refresh pass for region 2 */
	    InstallClipRegion( window->WLayer, region2 );
	    BeginRefresh( window );
	    myRefreshRegion2( window );
	    EndRefresh( window, TRUE );		/* and dispose damage list */

	    /* restore and unlock */
	    InstallClipRegion( window->WLayer, origclip );
	    UnlockLayerInfo( &window->WScreen->LayerInfo );
	    break;
	...
	}
	

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window structure which needs refreshing

    RESULT
	None

    NAME
	BuildEasyRequestArgs -- Simple creation of system request. (V36)
	BuildEasyRequest -- Varargs stub for BuildEasyRequestArgs(). (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	ReqWindow = BuildEasyRequestArgs( RefWindow, easyStruct, IDCMP, Args )
	D0                                A0         A1          D0     A3

	struct Window *BuildEasyRequestArgs( struct Window *,
		struct EasyStruct *, ULONG, APTR );

	ReqWindow = BuildEasyRequest( RefWindow, easyStruct, IDCMP, Arg1, ... )

	struct Window *BuildEasyRequest( struct Window *,
		struct EasyStruct *, ULONG, APTR, ... );

    FUNCTION
	This function is to EasyRequest() as BuildSysRequest() is to
	AutoRequest(): it returns a pointer to the system requester
	window.  The input from that window can then be processed
	under application control.

	It is recommended that this processing be done with
	SysReqHandler(), so that future enhancement to the
	processing will be enjoyed.

	After you have determined that the requester is satisfied or
	cancelled, you must free this requester using FreeSysRequest().

	Please see the autodoc for EasyRequest().

	NOTE: This function switches the processor stack to ensure
	sufficient stack space for the function to complete.

    INPUTS
	Window = reference window for requester: determines the
	    requester window title and screen.
	easyStruct = pointer to EasyStruct structure, as described
	    in the EasyRequest() autodocs.
	IDCMP = (NOT A POINTER) provided application specific IDCMP
	    flags for the system requester window.
	Args = see EasyRequestArgs()

    RESULT
	A pointer to the system request window opened.  In the event
	of problems, you may also be returned the value '0' which
	is to be interpreted as the "FALSE, Cancel" choice, or
	(if you have a second gadget defined) the value '1', which
	is to be taken to mean the equivalent of your corresponding
	left-most gadget.

	If there is a problem creating the window, a recoverable alert may
	be substituted for the requester, and the result, either 0 or 1,
	returned.

    BUGS
	Does not put up alternative alert.
	See also BUGS listed for EasyRequestArgs().

    NAME
	BuildSysRequest -- Build and display a system requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	ReqWindow = BuildSysRequest( Window, BodyText, PosText, NegText, 
	D0                           A0      A1        A2       A3
		           IDCMPFlags, Width, Height )
			   D0          D1     D2

	struct Window *BuildSysRequest( struct Window *, struct IntuiText *,
		struct IntuiText *, struct IntuiText *, ULONG, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	This procedure builds a system requester based on the supplied
	information.  If all goes well and the requester is constructed,
	this procedure returns a pointer to the window in which the requester
	appears.  That window will have its IDCMP initialized to reflect the
	flags found in the IDCMPFlags argument.  You may then wait on those
	ports to detect the user's response to your requester, which response
	may include either selecting one of the gadgets or causing some other
	event to be noticed by Intuition (like IDCMP_DISKINSERTED, for
	instance).  After the requester is satisfied, you should call the
	FreeSysRequest() procedure to remove the requester and free up
	any allocated memory.

	See the autodoc for SysReqHandler() for more information on the
	how to handle the IntuiMessages this window will receive.

	The requester used by this function has the NOISYREQ flag bit set,
	which means that the set of IDCMPFlags that may be used here
	include IDCMP_RAWKEY, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS, and others.
   
	In release previous to V36, if the requester could not be built,
	this function would try to call DisplayAlert() with the same
	information, with more or less favorable results.  In V36,
	the requesters themselves require less memory (SIMPLEREQ), but
	there is no alert attempt.

	The function may return TRUE (1) or FALSE if it cannot post
	the requester.  (V36 will always return FALSE, but be sure to
	test for TRUE in case somebody reinstates the fallback alert.)

	If the window argument you supply is equal to NULL, a new window will
	be created for you in the Workbench screen, or the default
	public screen, for V36.  If you want the requester
	created by this routine to be bound to a particular window (i.e.,
	to appear in the same screen as the window), you should
	not supply a window argument of NULL.

	New for V36: if you pass a NULL window pointer, the system requester
	will appear on the default public screen, which is not always
	the Workbench.

	The text arguments are used to construct the display.  Each is a
	pointer to an instance of the structure IntuiText.

	The BodyText argument should be used to describe the nature of 
	the requester.  As usual with IntuiText data, you may link several
	lines of text together, and the text may be placed in various 
	locations in the requester.  This IntuiText pointer will be stored
	in the ReqText variable of the new requester.

	The PosText argument describes the text that you want associated 
	with the user choice of "Yes,  TRUE,  Retry,  Good."  If the requester 
	is successfully opened, this text will be rendered in a gadget in 
	the lower-left of the requester, which gadget will have the 
	GadgetID field set to TRUE.  If the requester cannot be opened and 
	the DisplayAlert() mechanism is used, this text will be rendered in 
	the lower-left corner of the alert display with additional text 
	specifying that the left mouse button will select this choice.  This 
	pointer can be set to NULL, which specifies that there is no TRUE 
	choice that can be made.

	The NegText argument describes the text that you want associated 
	with the user choice of "No,  FALSE,  Cancel,  Bad."  If the requester 
	is successfully opened, this text will be rendered in a gadget in 
	the lower-right of the requester, which gadget will have the 
	GadgetID field set to FALSE.  If the requester cannot be opened and 
	the DisplayAlert() mechanism is used, this text will be rendered in 
	the lower-right corner of the alert display with additional text 
	specifying that the right mouse button will select this choice.  This 
	pointer cannot be set to NULL.  There must always be a way for the
	user to cancel this requester.

	The Positive and Negative Gadgets created by this routine have
	the following features:
          - GTYP_BOOLGADGET
          - GACT_RELVERIFY
          - GTYP_REQGADGET
          - GACT_TOGGLESELECT

	When defining the text for your gadgets, you may find it convenient
	to use the special constants used by Intuition for the construction
	of the gadgets.  These include defines like AUTODRAWMODE, AUTOLEFTEDGE,
	AUTOTOPEDGE and AUTOFRONTPEN.  You can find these in your local
	intuition.h (or intuition.i) file.

	These hard-coded constants are not very resolution or font
	sensitive, but V36 will override them to provide more modern
	layout.

	New for V36, linked lists of IntuiText are not correctly supported
	for gadget labels.

	The width and height values describe the size of the requester.  All
	of your BodyText must fit within the width and height of your
	requester.  The gadgets will be created to conform to your sizes.

	VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  for this release of this procedure, a new window
	is opened in the same screen as the one containing your window. 
	Future alternatives may be provided as a function distinct from this
	one.

	NOTE: This function will pop the screen the requester and its
	window appears in to the front of all screens.  New for V36,
	if the user doesn't perform any other screen arrangement before
	finishing with the requester, a popped screen will be pushed
	back behind.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure
	BodyText = pointer to an IntuiText structure
	PosText = pointer to an IntuiText structure
	NegText = pointer to an IntuiText structure
	IDCMPFlags = the IDCMP flags you want used for the initialization of the
           IDCMP of the window containing this requester
	Width, Height = the size required to render your requester

	NOTE for V36: the width and height you pass are ignored, as
	are some of the parameters of your IntuiText, so that Intuition
	can make the Requesters real nice for the new look.

    RESULT
	If the requester was successfully created, the value 
	returned by this procedure is a pointer to the window in which the 
	requester is rendered.  If the requester could not be created,
	this routine might have called DisplayAlert() before returning 
	(it depends on the version) and will pass back TRUE if the user
	pressed the left mouse button and FALSE if the user pressed the
	right mouse button.   If the version of Intuition doesn't 
	call DisplayAlert(), or if it does, and there's not enough
	memory for the alert, the value of FALSE is returned.

    BUGS
	This procedure currently opens a window in the Screen which 
	contains the window which is passed as a parameter, or the
	default public screen, if that parameter is NULL.  Although
	not as originally envisioned, this will probably always be the
	behavior of this function.

	DisplayAlert() is not called in version V36.

	It's almost impossible to make complete, correct account
	of different system fonts, window border dimensions, and
	screen resolution to get the layout of a System Requester
	just right using this routine.  For V36, we recommend the
	automatic layout implemented in BuildEasyRequestArgs() and
	EasyRequestArgs().

    NAME
	ChangeScreenBuffer -- Swap the screen's BitMap. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	success = ChangeScreenBuffer( Screen, ScreenBuffer )
	D0                            A0      A1

	ULONG ChangeScreenBuffer( struct Screen *, struct ScreenBuffer * );

    FUNCTION
	Performs double (or multiple) buffering on an Intuition screen
	in an Intuition-cooperative manner.  The BitMap associated
	with the supplied ScreenBuffer will be installed in the
	specified screen, if possible.  The previously-installed BitMap
	is available for re-use upon receiving a signal from
	graphics.library.  See the graphics.library autodocs for
	graphics.library/AllocDBufInfo() and graphics.library/ChangeVPBitMap()
	for details.

    INPUTS
	Screen: pointer to the screen whose bitmap is to be swapped.
	ScreenBuffer: pointer to a ScreenBuffer structure obtained from
	    AllocScreenBuffer().

    RESULT
	Returns non-zero if the operation succeeded.  Returns zero
	if the operation cannot be performed.  This function will
	fail if Intuition's state cannot permit it, for example the
	user is playing with menus or gadgets.

    NOTES
	It is not required to restore the original ScreenBuffer
	before closing the screen. Simply FreeScreenBuffer() each
	buffer (including the original and the currently-installed one)
	then close the screen.	Of course, you cannot call
	ChangeScreenBuffer() after freeing the currently-installed one.

intuition.library/ChangeWindowBox           intuition.library/ChangeWindowBox

    NAME
	ChangeWindowBox -- Change window position and dimensions. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	ChangeWindowBox( Window, Left, Top, Width, Height )
			 A0	 D0    D1   D2     D3

	VOID ChangeWindowBox( struct Window *, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	Makes simultaneous changes in window position and dimensions,
	in absolute (not relative) coordinates.

	Like MoveWindow() and SizeWindow(), the effect of this function
	is deferred until the next input comes along.  Unlike these 
	functions, ChangeWindowBox() specifies absolute window position
	and dimensions, not relative.  This makes for more reliable
	results considering that the action is deferred, so this
	function is typically preferable to MoveWindow() and SizeWindow()
	paired.

	You can detect that this operation has completed by receiving
	the IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP message

	The dimensions are limited to legal range, but you should still
	take care to specify sensible inputs based on the window's dimension
	limits and the size of its screen.

	This function limits the position and dimensions to legal
	values.

    INPUTS
	Window = the window to change position/dimension
	Left, Top, Width, Height = new position and dimensions

    RESULT
	Position and dimension are changed to your specification,
	or as close as possible.
	Returns nothing.

    SYNOPSIS
	Response = ClearDMRequest( Window )
	D0			   A0

	BOOL ClearDMRequest( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Attempts to clear the DMRequest from the specified window,
	that is detaches the special requester that you attach to 
	the double-click of the menu button which the user can then 
	bring up on demand.  This routine WILL NOT clear the DMRequest
	if it's active (in use by the user). The IDCMP message class
	IDCMP_REQCLEAR can be used to detect that the requester is not in use,
	but that message is sent only when the last of perhaps several
	requesters in use in a window is terminated.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window from which the DMRequest is to be cleared.

    RESULT
	If the DMRequest was not currently in use, detaches the DMRequest
	from the window and returns TRUE.

	If the DMRequest was currently in use, doesn't change anything
	and returns FALSE.

    FUNCTION
	Detaches the current menu strip from the window; menu strips
	are attached to windows using the SetMenuStrip() function
	(or, for V36, ResetMenuStrip() ).

	If the menu is in use (for that matter if any menu is in use)
	this function will block (Wait()) until the user has finished.

	Call this function before you make any changes to the data
	in a Menu or MenuItem structure which is part of a menu
	strip linked into a window.

		      A0

	VOID ClearPointer( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Clears the window of its own definition of the Intuition mouse pointer.  
	After calling ClearPointer(), every time this window is the active 
	one the default Intuition pointer will be the pointer displayed 
	to the user.  If your window is the active one when this routine 
	is called, the change will take place immediately.

	Custom definitions of the mouse pointer which this function clears
	are installed by a call to SetPointer().

	D0 (V36)               A0

	BOOL CloseScreen( struct Screen * );
	/* returns BOOL in V36 and greater */

    FUNCTION
	Unlinks the screen, unlinks the viewport, deallocates everything that
	Intuition allocated when the screen was opened (using OpenScreen()).
	Doesn't care whether or not there are still any windows attached to the
	screen.  Doesn't try to close any attached windows; in fact, ignores
	them altogether (but see below for changes in V36).

	If this is the last screen to go, attempts to reopen Workbench.

	New for V36: this function will refuse to close the screen
	if there are windows open on the screen or if there are any
	outstanding screen locks (see LockPubScreen()) when
	CloseScreen() is called.  This avoids the almost certain crash
	when a screen is closed out from under a window.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to the screen to be closed.

    RESULT
	New for V36: returns TRUE (1) if screen is closed,
	returns FALSE (0) if screen had open windows when
	called.

    NAME
	CloseWindow -- Close an Intuition window.

    SYNOPSIS
	CloseWindow( Window )
		     A0

	VOID CloseWindow( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Closes an Intuition window.  Unlinks it from the system, deallocates
	its memory, and makes it disappear.

	When this function is called, all IDCMP messages which have been sent
	to your window are deallocated.  If the window had shared a message
	Port with other windows, you must be sure that there are no unreplied
	messages for this window in the message queue.  Otherwise, your program
	will try to make use of a linked list (the queue) which contains free
	memory (the old messages).  This will give you big problems.
	See the code fragment CloseWindowSafely(), below.

	NOTE:  If you have added a Menu strip to this Window (via
	a call to SetMenuStrip()) you must be sure to remove that Menu strip
	(via a call to ClearMenuStrip()) before closing your Window.
	
	NOTE: This function may block until it is safe to de-link and free
	your window.  Your program may thus be suspended while the user
	plays with gadgets, menus, or window sizes and position.
	
	New for V36: If your window is a "Visitor Window" (see OpenWindow)
	CloseWindow will decrement the "visitor count" in the public screen
	on which the window was open.  When the last visitor window is
	closed, a signal will be sent to the public screen task, if this
	was pre-arranged (see OpenScreen).

	It is much more solid, although we haven't eliminated
	all the problem cases yet.
 
    BUGS 
	The name of this function is improperly spelled.  It ought
	to have been CloseWorkbench().

	It might be more convenient to have it return TRUE if the
	Workbench wasn't opened when called.  The idea as it is now
	is probably this: if you want to free up the memory of the 
	Workbench screen when your program begins, you can call
	CloseWorkBench().  The return value of that call indicates
	whether you should call OpenWorkBench() when your program 
	exits: if FALSE, that means either the the Workbench existed
	but you could not close it, or that it wasn't around to
	begin with, and you should not try to re-open it.

	We would prefer that you provide a user selection to attempt
	to open or close the Workbench screen from within your application,
	rather than your making assumptions like these.

    NAME
	CurrentTime -- Get the current time values.

    SYNOPSIS
	CurrentTime( Seconds, Micros )
		     A0       A1

	VOID CurrentTime( ULONG *, ULONG * );

    FUNCTION
	Puts copies of the current time into the supplied argument pointers.

	This time value is not extremely accurate, nor is it of a very fine 
	resolution.  This time will be updated no more than sixty times a
	a second, and will typically be updated far fewer times a second.

    INPUTS
	Seconds = pointer to a LONG variable to receive the current seconds
	    value
	Micros = pointer to a LONG variable for the current microseconds value

    RESULT
	Puts the time values into the memory locations specified by the
	    arguments
	Return value is not defined.

    NAME
	DisplayAlert -- Create the display of an alert message.

    SYNOPSIS
	Response = DisplayAlert( AlertNumber, String, Height )
	D0			 D0           A0      D1

	BOOL DisplayAlert( ULONG, UBYTE *, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	Creates an alert display with the specified message.

	If the system can recover from this alert, it's a RECOVERY_ALERT and 
	this routine waits until the user presses one of the mouse buttons, 
	after which the display is restored to its original state and a 
	BOOL value is returned by this routine to specify whether or not 
	the user pressed the LEFT mouse button.
   
	If the system cannot recover from this alert, it's a DEADEND_ALERT
	and this routine returns immediately upon creating the alert display.
	The return value is FALSE.

	NOTE: Starting with V33, if Intuition can't get enough
	memory for a RECOVERY_ALERT, the value FALSE will be returned.

	AlertNumber is a LONG value, historically related to the value
	sent to the Alert() routine.  But the only bits that are pertinent to
	this routine are the ALERT_TYPE bit(s).  These bits must be set to
	either RECOVERY_ALERT for alerts from which the system may safely
	recover, or DEADEND_ALERT for those fatal alerts.  These states are
	described in the paragraph above.   There is a third type of
	alert, the DAISY_ALERT, which is used only by the Exec.
   
	The string argument points to an AlertMessage string.  The AlertMessage
	string is comprised of one or more substrings, each of which is 
	composed of the following components:
           - first, a 16-bit x-coordinate and an 8-bit y-coordinate, 
             describing where on the alert display you want this string
             to appear.  The y-coordinate describes the offset to the
             baseline of the text.
           - then, the bytes of the string itself, which must be
             null-terminated (end with a byte of zero)
           - lastly, the continuation byte, which specifies whether or
             not there's another substring following this one.  If the
             continuation byte is non-zero, there IS another substring
             to be processed in this alert message.  If the continuation
             byte is zero, this is the last substring in the message.

	The last argument, Height, describes how many video lines tall you 
	want the alert display to be.

	New for V36: Alerts are always rendered in Topaz 8 (80 column font),
	regardless of the system default font.  Also, RECOVERY_ALERTs are
	displayed in amber, while DEADEND_ALERTs are still red.  Alerts
	no longer push down the application screens to be displayed.  Rather,
	they appear alone in a black display.

	Also new for V36: Alerts block each other out, and input
	during an alert is deprived of the rest of the system.  Internal
	input buffers still cause alert clicks to be processed by
	applications sometimes.

    INPUTS
	AlertNumber = the number of this alert message.  The only pertinent
	    bits of this number are the ALERT_TYPE bit(s).  The rest of the
           number is ignored by this routine.
	String = pointer to the alert message string, as described above
	Height = minimum display lines required for your message

    RESULT
	A BOOL value of TRUE or FALSE.  If this is a DEADEND_ALERT, FALSE
	is always the return value.  If this is a RECOVERY_ALERT. The return
	value will be TRUE if the user presses the left mouse button in 
	response to your message, and FALSE if the user presses the right hand 
	button is response to your text, or if the alert could not
	be posted.

    BUGS
	If the system is worse off than you think, the level of your alert
	may become DEADEND_ALERT without you ever knowing about it.  This
	will NOT happen due simply to low memory.  Rather, the alert 
	display will be skipped, and FALSE will be returned.

	The left and right button clicks satisfying the alerts are
	unfortunately passed to	the normal applications, because of
	some internal system input buffering.

intuition.library/DisplayBeep                   intuition.library/DisplayBeep

    NAME
	DisplayBeep -- Flash the video display.

    SYNOPSIS
	DisplayBeep( Screen )
		     A0

	VOID DisplayBeep( struct Screen * );

    FUNCTION
	"Beeps" the video display by flashing the background color of the
	specified screen.  If the screen argument is NULL, every screen
	in the display will be beeped.  Flashing everyone's screen is not
	a polite thing to do, so this should be reserved for dire
	circumstances.

	The reason such a routine is supported is because the Amiga has
	no internal bell or speaker.  When the user needs to know of
	an event that is not serious enough to require the use of a requester,
	the DisplayBeep() function may be called.

	New for V36:  Intuition now calls DisplayBeep through the 
	external library vector.  This means that if you call SetFunction()
	to replace DisplayBeep with an audible beep, for example, then
	your change will affect even Intuition's calls to DisplayBeep.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to a screen.  If NULL, every screen in the display
           will be flashed

    RESULT
	None

    NOTES
	Since this function changes color zero of the affected screen(s),
	surprising results could occur if the screen's owner reading
	colors or perhaps cycling them.

    SYNOPSIS
	DisposeObject( Object )
	               A0

	VOID DisposeObject( APTR );

    FUNCTION
	Deletes a boopsi object and all of it auxiliary data.
	These objects are all created by NewObject().  Objects
	of certain classes "own" other objects, which will also
	be deleted when the object is passed to DisposeObject().
	Read the per-class documentation carefully to be aware
	of these instances.

    INPUTS
	Object = abstract pointer to a boopsi object returned by NewObject().
		The pointer may be NULL, in which case this function has
		no effect.

    NOTES
	This function invokes the OM_DISPOSE method.

    RESULT

    NAME
	DoGadgetMethodA -- Invoke method on a boopsi gadget. (V39)
	DoGadgetMethod -- Varargs stub for DoGadgetMethodA(). (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	result = DoGadgetMethodA( Gadget, Window, Requester, Message )
	D0		          A0      A1      A2         A3

		struct Requester *, Msg );

	result = DoGadgetMethod( Gadget, Window, Requester, MethodID, ...)

	ULONG DoGadgetMethod( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester *, ULONG, ... );

    FUNCTION
	Same as the DoMethod() function of amiga.lib, but provides context
	information and arbitration for classes which implement custom
	Intuition gadgets.

	You should use this function for boopsi gadget objects,
	or for "models" which propagate information to gadgets.

	Unlike DoMethod(), this function provides a GadgetInfo pointer
	(if possible) when invoking the method.  Some classes may
	require or benefit from this.

    INPUTS
	Gadget = abstract pointer to a boopsi gadget
	Window = window gadget has been added to using AddGList() or AddGadget()
	Requester = for REQGADGETs, requester containing the gadget
	Msg = the boopsi message to send

    RESULT
	The object does whatever it wants with the message you sent,
	which might include updating its gadget visuals.

	The return value is defined per-method.
	
    NOTES
	This function invokes the specified method with a GadgetInfo
	derived from the 'Window' and 'Requester' pointers.  The GadgetInfo
	is passed as the second parameter of the message, except for
	OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_NOTIFY, and OM_UPDATE, where the GadgetInfo
	is passed as the third parameter.

	Implementers of new gadget methods should ensure that the
	GadgetInfo is the second long-word of their message!

    SYNOPSIS
	IsDouble = DoubleClick( StartSecs, StartMicros,
	D0                      D0         D1
		CurrentSecs, CurrentMicros )
		D2           D3

	BOOL DoubleClick( ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	Compares the difference in the time values with the double-click 
	timeout range that the user has set (using the "Preferences" tool) or 
	some other program has configured into the system.  If the 
	difference between the specified time values is within the current 
	double-click time range, this function returns TRUE, else it 
	returns FALSE.  

       These time values can be found in input events and IDCMP messages.
       The time values are not perfect; however, they are precise enough for 
       nearly all applications.

    INPUTS
	StartSeconds, StartMicros = the timestamp value describing the start of
          the double-click time period you are considering
	CurrentSeconds, CurrentMicros = the timestamp value describing 
          the end of the double-click time period you are considering

    RESULT
	If the difference between the supplied timestamp values is within the
	double-click time range in the current set of Preferences, this
	function returns TRUE, else it returns FALSE

    SYNOPSIS
	DrawBorder( RastPort, Border, LeftOffset, TopOffset )
		    A0        A1      D0          D1

	VOID DrawBorder( struct RastPort *, struct Border *, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	First, sets up the draw mode and pens in the RastPort according to the
	arguments of the Border structure.  Then, draws the vectors of
	the border argument into the RastPort, offset by the left and top
	offsets.

	As with all graphics rendering routines, the border will be clipped to
	to the boundaries of the RastPort's layer, if it exists.  This is
	the case with window RastPorts.

	This routine will draw all borders in the NULL-terminated list linked
	by the NextBorder field of the border argument.

    INPUTS
	RastPort = pointer to the RastPort to receive the border rendering
	Border = pointer to a Border structure
	LeftOffset = the offset to be added to each vector's x coordinate
	TopOffset = the offset to be added to each vector's y coordinate

    NAME
	DrawImage -- Draw the specified Image structure into a RastPort.

    SYNOPSIS
	DrawImage( RastPort, Image, LeftOffset, TopOffset )
		   A0        A1     D0          D1

	VOID DrawImage( struct RastPort *, struct Image	*, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	First, sets up the draw mode and pens in the RastPort according to the
	arguments of the Image structure.  Then, moves the image data of
	the image argument into the RastPort, offset by the left and top
	offsets.
	
	This routine does window layer clipping if you pass your window's
	(layered) RastPort -- if you draw an image outside of your window,
	your imagery will be clipped at the window's edge.  If you pass
	a (non-layered) screen RastPort, you MUST be sure your image is
	wholly contained within the rastport bounds.

	If the NextImage field of the image argument is non-NULL, 
	the next image is rendered as well, and so on until some
	NextImage field is found to be NULL.

    INPUTS
	RastPort = pointer to the RastPort to receive image rendering
	Image = pointer to an image structure
	LeftOffset = the offset which will be added to the image's x coordinate
	TopOffset = the offset which will be added to the image's y coordinate

    RESULT
	None

    NOTES
	Intuition always has and will continue to assume there are
	at least as many planes of data pointed to by ImageData as there
	are '1' bits in the PlanePick field.  Please ensure that
	this is so.  (See the intuition.h include file for full details

   SYNOPSIS
	DrawImageState( RPort, Image, LeftOffset, TopOffset, State, DrawInfo )
			A0     A1     D0          D1         D2     A2
	
	VOID DrawImageState( struct RastPort *, struct Image *,
		WORD, WORD, ULONG, struct DrawInfo * );

   FUNCTION
	This function draws an Intuition Image structure in a variety of
	"visual states," which are defined by constants in
	intuition/imageclass.h.  These include:
	IDS_NORMAL		- like DrawImage()
	IDS_SELECTED		- represents the "selected state" of a Gadget
	IDS_DISABLED		- the "ghosted state" of a gadget
	IDS_BUSY		- for future functionality
	IDS_INDETERMINATE	- for future functionality
	IDS_INACTIVENORMAL	- for gadgets in window border
	IDS_INACTIVESELECTED	- for gadgets in window border
	IDS_INACTIVEDISABLED	- for gadgets in window border

	Only IDS_NORMAL will make sense for traditional Image structures,
	this function is more useful when applied to new custom images
	or "object-oriented image classes."

	Each class of custom images is responsible for documenting which
	visual states it supports, and you typically want to use images
	which support the appropriate states with your custom gadgets.

	The DrawInfo parameter provides information invaluable to 
	"rendered" images, such as pen color and resolution.  Each
	image class must document whether this parameter is required.

   INPUTS
 	RPort	- RastPort for rendering
	Image	- pointer to a (preferably custom) image
	LeftOffset,RightOffset - positional offsets in pixels
	State	- visual state selected from above
	DrawInfo - pointer to packed of pen selections and resolution.

   RESULT
 	None.

    NAME

	EasyRequest -- Varargs stub for EasyRequestArgs(). (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	num = EasyRequestArgs( Window, easyStruct, IDCMP_ptr, ArgList )

	    UBYTE	*es_Title;
	    UBYTE	*es_TextFormat;
	    UBYTE	*es_GadgetFormat;
	};

    FUNCTION
	This function provides a simpler method of using a 'System
	Requester' than provided by AutoRequest().  It performs layout
	and size calculations sensitive to the current font and screen
	resolution.

	It provides for the descriptive 'body' text and the gadget
	text to be constructed from 'printf' style format strings.

	It also provides a general way for the requester to be
	sensitive to particular IDCMP messages.
	
	The first function listed is the actual Intuition library
	function.  It is passed the arguments for the formatting
	operations as a pointer to the first argument.

	The second function uses a C-style variable number of argument
	(varargs) calling convention.  It should be implemented as
	a call to the first function, and might be supplied by your
	compiler vendor, in amiga.lib, or using the first example below,
	for most C compilers.

	NOTE: The formatting is done by exec.library/RawDoFmt(), so
	be aware that to display a 32-bit integer argument, for
	example, you must say "%ld", not "%d", since RawDoFmt() is
	"word-oriented."

	NOTE: This function switches the processor stack to ensure
	sufficient stack space for the function to complete.

    EXAMPLES
	/* varargs interface works for most C compilers */
	EasyRequest( w, es, ip, arg1 )
	struct Window	*w;
	struct EasyStruct *es;

    INPUTS
	Window = Reference window pointer, determines the screen and
	    title of the requester window.  This can be NULL, which
	    means the requester is to appear on the Workbench screen,
	    or default public screen, if defined.
	IDCMP_ptr = Pointer to IDCMP flags that you want to terminate
		the requester.  This pointer may be NULL.
	easyStruct = Pointer to EasyStruct structure with fields
		interpreted as follows:

	es_StructSize = sizeof (struct EasyStruct), for future extension.
	es_Flags = 0 for now, in the future may specify other options.
	es_Title = Title of system requester window.  If this is NULL,
	    the title will be taken to be the same as the title of 'Window',
	    if provided, or else "System Request."
	es_TextFormat = Format string, a la RawDoFmt(), for message in
	    requester body.  Lines are separated by the newline character.
	    This character is represented in C by '\n', in the Amiga Shell
	    by "*N", etc.  Formatting '%' functions are supported exactly
	    as in RawDoFmt().
	es_GadgetFormat = Format string for gadgets.  Text for separate 
	    gadgets is separated by '|'.  Format functions are supported.
	    You MUST specify at least one gadget.

	ArgList = Arguments for format commands.   Arguments for
	    GadFmt follow arguments for TextFmt.

    RESULT
	0, 1, ..., N = Successive GadgetID values, for the gadgets
	    you specify for the requester.  NOTE: The numbering
	    from left to right is actually: 1, 2, ..., N, 0.
	    This is for compatibility with AutoRequest(), which has
	    FALSE for the rightmost gadget.
	    
	-1 = Means that one of the caller-supplied IDCMPFlags occurred.
	    The IDCMPFlag value is in the longword pointed to by IDCMP_ptr.

    NOTES
	When DOS brings up EasyRequests() on your process (eg.
	"Please insert volume XXX in any drive", they normally come
	up on the default public screen, which is usually the Workbench
	screen.  If you set your Process pr_WindowPtr field to point to
	one of your windows, then DOS will bring its requesters up on the
	same screen as that window.  A pr_WindowPtr of -1 prevents
	requesters from coming up at all.
	(Some FileSystem requesters cannot be redirected or supressed).

    BUGS
	Does not fall back to a recoverable alert if the requester
	 cannot be created.

	Does not handle case when gadgets don't fit or window title
	is too long, although it does trim trailing spaces from the
	title for calculating dimensions.

    PLANS
	Possible enhancements include: centering of text, size-sensitive
	layout,  window-relative requester, vertical gadget layout,
	window placement, more keyboard shortcuts.

	We also reserve the use of the newline character ('\n') in
	gadget format strings for future use as a line separator.

    NAME
	EndRefresh -- End the optimized refresh state of the window.

    SYNOPSIS
	EndRefresh( Window, Complete )
		    A0      D0

	VOID EndRefresh( struct Window *, BOOL );

    FUNCTION
	This function gets you out of the special refresh state of your 
	window.  It is called following a call to BeginRefresh(), which 
	routine puts you into the special refresh state.  While your window
	is in the refresh state, the only rendering that will be wrought in
	your window will be to those areas which were recently revealed and
	need to be refreshed.

	After you've done all the refreshing you want to do for this window, 
	you should call this routine to restore the window to its
	non-refreshing state.  Then all rendering will go to the entire
	window, as usual.
   
	The 'Complete' argument is a boolean TRUE or FALSE value used to 
	describe whether or not the refreshing you've done was all the
	refreshing that needs to be done at this time.  Most often, this
	argument will be TRUE.  But if, for instance, you have multiple
	tasks or multiple procedure calls which must run to completely
	refresh the window, then each can call its own Begin/EndRefresh() 
	pair with a Complete argument of FALSE, and only the last calls
	with a Complete argument of TRUE.

	WARNING:  Passing this function the value of FALSE has its
	pitfalls.  Please see the several caveats in the autodoc for
	BeginRefresh().

	For your information, this routine calls the Layers library function
	EndUpdate(), unlocks your layers (calls UnlockLayerRom()), clears
	the LAYERREFRESH bit in your Layer Flags, and clears the
	WFLG_WINDOWREFRESH bit in your window Flags.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window currently in optimized-refresh mode
	Complete = Boolean TRUE or FALSE describing whether or not this
           window is completely refreshed

	None

    FUNCTION
	Ends the request by erasing the requester and decoupling it from
	the window.

	Note that this doesn't necessarily clear all requesters from the window,
	only the specified one.  If the window labors under other requesters,
	they will remain in the window.

    INPUTS
	Requester = pointer to the requester to be removed

    SYNOPSIS
	success = FreeClass( ClassPtr )
	D0                   A0

	BOOL FreeClass( struct IClass * );

    FUNCTION
	For class implementors only.

	Tries to free a boopsi class created by MakeClass().  This
	won't always succeed: classes with outstanding objects or
	with subclasses cannot be freed.  You cannot allow the code
	which implements the class to be unloaded in this case.

	For public classes, this function will *always* remove
	the class (see RemoveClass() ) making it unavailable, whether
	it succeeds or not.
	
	If you have a dynamically allocated data for your class (hanging
	off of cl_UserData), try to free the class before you free the
	user data, so you don't get stuck with a half-freed class.

    INPUTS
	ClassPtr - pointer to a class created by MakeClass().

    RESULT
	Returns FALSE if the class could not be freed.  Reasons include,
	but will not be limited to, having non-zero cl_ObjectCount or
	cl_SubclassCount.

	Returns TRUE if the class could be freed.

	Calls RemoveClass() for the class in either case.
	
    EXAMPLE
	Freeing a private class with dynamically allocated user data:

	freeMyClass( cl )
	struct IClass	*cl;
	{
	    struct MyPerClassData	*mpcd;

	    mpcd = (struct MyPerClassData *) cl->cl_UserData;
	    if ( FreeClass( cl ) )
	    {

intuition.library/FreeRemember                 intuition.library/FreeRemember

    NAME
	FreeRemember -- Free memory allocated by calls to AllocRemember().

    SYNOPSIS
	FreeRemember( RememberKey, ReallyForget )
		      A0           D0

	VOID FreeRemember( struct Remember **, BOOL );

    FUNCTION
	This function frees up memory allocated by the AllocRemember() function.
	It will either free up just the Remember structures, which supply the
	link nodes that tie your allocations together, or it will deallocate
	both the link nodes AND your memory buffers too.
	
	If you want to deallocate just the Remember structure link nodes,
	you should set the ReallyForget argument to FALSE.  However, if you
	want FreeRemember to really deallocate all the memory, including
	both the Remember structure link nodes and the buffers you requested
	via earlier calls to AllocRemember(), then you should set the 
	ReallyForget argument to TRUE.

	NOTE WELL: Once you call this function passing it FALSE, the
	linkages between all the memory chunks are lost, and you
	cannot subsequently use FreeRemember() to free them.

    INPUTS
	RememberKey = the address of a pointer to struct Remember.  This
           pointer should either be NULL or set to some value (possibly
           NULL) by a call to AllocRemember().
	ReallyForget = a BOOL FALSE or TRUE describing, respectively, 
           whether you want to free up only the Remember nodes or 
           if you want this procedure to really forget about all of 
           the memory, including both the nodes and the memory buffers 
           referenced by the nodes.

    EXAMPLE
	struct Remember *RememberKey;
	RememberKey = NULL;
	AllocRemember(&RememberKey, BUFSIZE, MEMF_CHIP);
	FreeRemember(&RememberKey, TRUE);

    NAME
	FreeScreenBuffer -- Free a ScreenBuffer structure. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	FreeScreenBuffer( Screen, ScreenBuffer )
	                  A0      A1

	VOID FreeScreenBuffer( struct Screen *, struct ScreenBuffer * );

    FUNCTION
	Frees a ScreenBuffer structure you got from AllocScreenBuffer(),
	and releases associated resources.  You must call FreeScreenBuffer()
	before you close your screen.

    INPUTS
	Screen: pointer to the screen this ScreenBuffer is associated with.
	ScreenBuffer: pointer to a ScreenBuffer structure obtained from
	    AllocScreenBuffer().  It is safe to call this function with
	    a NULL argument.  It will have no effect.

    RESULT
	None.

    NOTES
	Originally, FreeScreenBuffer() did not WaitBlit() before freeing
	a BitMap.  The intent was that the application should do this.
	However, as this sort of thing is easily forgotten, WaitBlit()
	was added in V40.  Application writers should ensure that freeing
	the buffer is safe by calling WaitBlit() themselves.

	The SB_SCREEN_BITMAP flag instructs AllocScreenBuffer() to provide
	a ScreenBuffer referring to the screen's actual bitmap.  When
	you are done changing screen buffers, you must FreeScreenBuffer()
	the currently-installed ScreenBuffer before you close the screen.
	Intuition will recognize when FreeScreenBuffer() is called for
	the currently-installed ScreenBuffer, and will know to free the
	supporting structures but not the BitMap.  CloseScreen() will
	take care of that.

	VOID FreeScreenDrawInfo( struct Screen *, struct DrawInfo * );

   FUNCTION
	Declares that you are finished with the DrawInfo structure

   INPUTS
 	Screen - pointer to screen passed to GetScreenDrawInfo().
	DrInfo - pointer to DrawInfo returned by GetScreenDrawInfo().
	    A NULL DrawInfo pointer is a valid parameter, signifying
	    "do nothing".

   RESULT
 	None

   NOTES
	This function, and GetScreenDrawInfo(), don't really do much, but
	they provide an upward compatibility path.  That means that
	if you misuse them today, they probably won't cause a problem,
	although they may someday later.  So, please be very careful
	only to use the DrawInfo structure between calls to
	GetScreenDrawInfo() and FreeScreenDrawInfo(), and be sure
	that you don't forget FreeScreenDrawInfo().

    SYNOPSIS
	FreeSysRequest( Window )
		        A0

	VOID FreeSysRequest( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	This routine frees up all memory allocated by a successful call to
	the BuildSysRequest() procedure.  If BuildSysRequest() returned a
	pointer to a window, then you are able to wait on the message port
	of that window to detect an event which satisfies the requester.
	When you want to remove the requester, you call this procedure.  It
	ends the requester and deallocates any memory used in the creation
	of the requester.  It also closes the special window that was opened
	for your system requester.

	For V36: It's OK if you pass a NULL or a TRUE (1) value to
	this function.  Also, this function properly disposes of
	requesters gotten using BuildEasyRequestArgs().

    SYNOPSIS
	GadgetMouse( Gadget, GInfo, MousePoint )
		     A0      A1     A2

	VOID GadgetMouse( struct GadgetInfo *, WORD * );

    FUNCTION
	Determines the current location of the mouse pointer relative
	to the upper-left corner of a custom gadget.  Typically used
	only in the GM_HANDLEINPUT and GM_GOACTIVE custom gadget hook
	routines.

	NEWS FLASH!!: These two hook routines are now passed the mouse
	coordinates, so this function has no known usefulness.

	We recommend that you don't call it.

	Note that this function calculates the mouse position taking
	"gadget relativity" (GFLG_RELRIGHT, GFLG_RELBOTTOM) into
	consideration.  If your custom gadget intends to ignore these
	properties, then you should either enjoin or inhibit your users
	from setting those bits, since Intuition won't ask if you respect
	them.

    INPUTS
	GInfo = A pointer to a GadgetInfo structure as passed to the
		custom gadget hook routine.
	MousePoint = address of two WORDS, or a pointer to a structure of
		type Point.

    RESULT
	Returns nothing.  Fills in the two words pointed to by
	MousePoint with the gadget-relative mouse position.

    BUGS
	Useless, since equivalent information is now passed to every
	function that might have a use for this.

    SYNOPSIS

	D0		D0	A0	A1

	ULONG GetAttr( ULONG, APTR, ULONG * );

    FUNCTION
	Inquires from the specified object the value of the specified attribute.

	You always pass the address of a long variable, which will
	receive the same value that would be passed to SetAttrs() in
	the ti_Data portion of a TagItem element.  See the documentation
	for the class for exceptions to this general rule.
	
	Not all attributes will respond to this function.  Those that
	will are documented on a class-by-class basis.

    INPUTS
	AttrID = the attribute tag ID understood by the object's class
	Object = abstract pointer to the boopsi object you are interested in
	StoragePtr = pointer to appropriate storage for the answer

    RESULT
	Returns FALSE (0) if the inquiries of attribute are not provided

    SYNOPSIS
	GetDefaultPubScreen( Namebuff )
			     A0

	VOID GetDefaultPubScreen( UBYTE * );

    FUNCTION
	Provides the name of the current default public screen.
	Only anticipated use is for Public Screen Manager utilities,
	since it is easy to open a visitor window on the default
	public screen without specifying the name.

    INPUTS
	Namebuff = a buffer of MAXPUBSCREENNAME.  This can be NULL.

    RESULT
	None.  Will provide the string "Workbench" in Namebuff if there
	is no current default public screen.

    NOTES
	This function actually "returns" in register D0 a pointer
	to the public screen.  Unfortunately, the lifespan of
	this pointer is not ensured; the screen could be closed
	at any time.  The *ONLY* legitimate use we can see for
	this return value is to compare for identity with the pointer
	to a public screen you either have a window open in, or
	a lock on using LockPubScreen(), to determine if that
	screen is in fact the default screen.

	Also note that if there no default public screen has been set,
	the return value of this function will be zero, and not a pointer
	to the Workbench screen.

	The function prototype does not reflect the return value.

    FUNCTION
	Gets a copy of the Intuition default preferences data.  Writes the
	data into the buffer you specify.  The number of bytes you want
	copied is specified by the size argument.

	The default preferences are those that Intuition uses when it
	is first opened.  If no preferences file is found, these are
	the preferences that are used.  These would also be the startup
	preferences in an AmigaDOS-less environment.
   
	It is legal to take a partial copy of the Preferences structure.
	The more pertinent preferences variables have been grouped near
	the top of the structure to facilitate the memory conservation
	that can be had by taking a copy of only some of the Preferences
	structure.

    INPUTS
	PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer to receive your copy of the
                Intuition Preferences structure

	New for V36:  A new and more extensible method for supplying
	Preferences has been introduced in V36, and relies on file
	system notification.  The Intuition preferences items rely
	also on the IPrefs program.  Certain elements of the
	Preferences structure have been superseded by this new method.
	As much as possible, the Preferences structure returned by
	GetPrefs() reflect the current state of Preferences.  However,
	it is impossible to represent some of the V36-style preferences
	items using the existing Preferences structure.

    INPUTS
	PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer to receive your copy of the

    SYNOPSIS 
	Success = GetScreenData( Buffer, Size, Type, Screen ) 
	D0                       A0      D0    D1    A1

	BOOL GetScreenData( APTR, UWORD, UWORD, struct Screen * );
 
    FUNCTION 
	This function copies into the caller's buffer data from a Screen
	structure.  Typically, this call will be used to find the size, title
	bar height, and other values for a standard screen, such as the
	Workbench screen.

	To get the data for the Workbench screen, one would call:
	    GetScreenData(buff, sizeof(struct Screen), WBENCHSCREEN, NULL)

	NOTE: if the requested standard screen is not open, this function
	will have the effect of opening it.

	This function has been useful for two basic types of things:
	1) Determining information about the Workbench screen, in
	   preparation for opening a window on it.
	2) Attempts at discerning the user's preferences in a working
	   screen, for "cloning" the Workbench modes and dimensions
	   when opening a similar custom screen.

	Providing compatibility with both of these goals has proven
	difficult, as we introduce new display modes and screen scrolling
	in V36.  Read carefully the somewhat involved exceptions we
	elected to implement ...

	Changes as of V36:

	For V36 and later, the function LockPubScreen() is an improvement
	over this function, in that it doesn't copy the screen data
	but returns a pointer and a guarantee that the screen will not
	be closed.

	If the global public screen SHANGHAI mode is in effect (see
	SetPubScreenModes() ), this function will actually report on
	the default public screen, where "Workbench" windows will
	actually open.

	For V36 and later, this function does some "compatibility tricks"
	when you inquire about the WBENCHSCREEN.  To keep programs from
	"stumbling" into modes they don't understand, and because an NTSC
	machine may be running a PAL Workbench or PRODUCTIVITY, for example,
	the following "false" information is returned.

	The Screen.ViewPort.Modes field will either be HIRES or HIRES+LACE
	(with the SPRITES flag also set, as usual).  HIRES+LACE is
	used if the display mode selected for the Workbench screen
	is an interlaced screen of any type.
	
	The dimensions returned will be the *smaller* of the OSCAN_TEXT
	dimensions for the returned mode, and the actual dimensions
	of the Workbench screen.

	EXCEPTION: For specific compatibility considerations, if the
	Workbench is in one of the A2024 modes, the mode returned
	in Screen.ViewPort.Modes will be HIRES+LACE (with perhaps
	some "special" bits also set for future improvement), but
	with dimensions equal to the actual A2024-mode Workbench screen.
	This will favor programs which open windows on the A2024
	Workbench, but will cause some problems for programs which
	try to "clone" the Workbench screen using this function.

	If you want the real information about the modern Workbench
	screen, call LockPubScreen( "Workbench" ) and acquire its
	display mode ID by inquiring of the actual ViewPort (using
	graphics.library/GetVPModeID() ).

	You may then use the information you get to clone as many of
	the properties of the Workbench screen that you wish.

	In the long run, it's probably better to provide your user
	with a screen mode selection option, and skip all this.
 
    INPUTS 
	Buffer = pointer to a buffer into which data can be copied
	Size   = the size of the buffer provided, in bytes
	Type   = the screen type, as specified in OpenWindow() (WBENCHSCREEN,
	    CUSTOMSCREEN, ...)
	Screen = ignored, unless type is CUSTOMSCREEN, which results only in
	    copying 'size' bytes from 'screen' to 'buffer'
 
    RESULT 
	TRUE if successful
	FALSE if standard screen of Type 'type' could not be opened.
 
    BUGS 
	You cannot support the new V36 display modes using this function.

   INPUTS
 	Screen        - pointer to a valid, open screen.

   RESULT
 	DrInfo - pointer to a system-allocated DrawInfo structure,
	as defined in intuition/screens.h.

   NOTES
	Some information in the DrawInfo structure may in the future
	be calculated the first time this function is called for a
	particular screen.

	You must call FreeScreenDrawInfo() when you are done using the
	returned pointer.

	This function does not prevent a screen from closing.  Apply it
	only to the screens you opened yourself, or apply a protocol
	such as LockPubScreen().

	WARNING: Until further notice, the pointer returned does not
	remain valid after the screen is closed.

	This function and FreeScreenDrawInfo() don't really do much now,
	but they provide an upward compatibility path.  That means that
	if you misuse them today, they probably won't cause a problem,
	although they may someday later.  So, please be very careful

    FUNCTION
	Initializes a requester for general use.  After calling InitRequester,
	you need fill in only those Requester values that fit your needs.
	The other values are set to NULL--or zero--states.

	Note that the example in the early versions of the Intuition

    BUGS
	Since the publication of the first Intuition Manual to this

	ItemAddress -- Returns the address of the specified MenuItem.

    SYNOPSIS
	Item = ItemAddress( MenuStrip, MenuNumber )
	D0		    A0         D0

	struct MenuItem *ItemAddress( struct Menu *, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	This routine feels through the specified menu strip and returns the 
	address of the item specified by the menu number.  Typically,
	you will use this routine to get the address of a menu item from
	a menu number sent to you by Intuition after user has chosen from
	a window's menus.  

       This routine requires that the arguments are well-defined.
	MenuNumber may be equal to MENUNULL, in which case this routine returns
	NULL.  If MenuNumber doesn't equal MENUNULL, it's presumed to be a 
	valid item number selector for your menu strip, which includes:
           - a valid menu number
           - a valid item number
           - if the item specified by the above two components has a
             sub-item, the menu number may have a sub-item component, too.

	Note that there must be BOTH a menu number and an item number.  
	Because a sub-item specifier is optional, the address returned by
	this routine may point to either an item or a sub-item.

    INPUTS
	MenuStrip = a pointer to the first menu in your menu strip
	MenuNumber = the value which contains the packed data that selects
           the menu and item (and sub-item).  See the Intuition Reference
	    Manual for information on menu numbers.

    RESULT
	If MenuNumber == MENUNULL, this routine returns NULL,
	else this routine returns the address of the menu item specified
	by MenuNumber.

intuition.library/LendMenus                       intuition.library/LendMenus

    NAME
	LendMenus -- Lend window's menu action to another window. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	LendMenus( fromWindow, toWindow )
	           A0          A1

	VOID LendMenus( struct Window *, struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	This function is used to "lend" the menus of one window to
	another.  This means that menu events (for example, the user
	presses the mouse menu button) will take place in another
	window's menu (using that other window's menu strip and screen).

	The sole intended use of this function is to unify two
	windows on different screens that are attached.  (See
	SA_Parent, SA_FrontChild, SA_BackChild).  An example would
	be a program with a full-sized parent screen which has a
	short control panel screen attached in the front.  Pressing the
	menu button even when the control panel window of the canvas
	screen is active can now cause the menus of the parent screen
	to appear.

    INPUTS
	fromWindow = pointer to the Window structure whose menu actions
	    are to go to another window.
	toWindow = pointer to the Window structure whose menus are to
	    be displayed in place of the fromWindow's.  If NULL, turns
	    off menu-lending from the fromWindow.

    RESULT
	None.

    BUGS
	The current behavior is such that the toWindow is temporarily
	activated.  This may not continue to be the case.  Be prepared
	to handle this!

intuition.library/LockIBase                       intuition.library/LockIBase

    NAME
	LockIBase -- Invoke semaphore arbitration of IntuitionBase.

    SYNOPSIS
	Lock = LockIBase( LockNumber )
	D0                D0

	ULONG LockIBase( ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	Grabs Intuition internal semaphore so that caller may examine
	IntuitionBase safely.  This function is not a magic "fix all my
	race conditions" panacea.

	The idea here is that you can get the locks Intuition needs before
	such IntuitionBase fields as ActiveWindow and FirstScreen are
	changed, or linked lists of windows and screens are changed.

	Do Not Get Tricky with this entry point, and do not hold these locks
	for long, as all Intuition input processing will wait for you to
	surrender the lock by a call to UnlockIBase().

	NOTE WELL: A call to this function MUST be paired with a subsequent
	call to UnlockIBase(), and soon, please.

	NOTE WELL: Do not call any Intuition functions (nor any graphics,
	layers, dos, or other high-level system function) while
	holding this lock.

    INPUTS
	A long unsigned integer, LockNumber, specifies which of Intuition's
	internal locks you want to get.  This parameter should be zero for all
	forseeable uses of this function, which will let you examine active
	fields and linked lists of screens and windows with safety.

    RESULT
	Returns another ULONG which should be passed to UnlockIBase() to
	surrender the lock gotten by this call.

    BUGS
	This function must not be called while holding any other system locks
	such as layer or LayerInfo locks.

intuition.library/LockPubScreen               intuition.library/LockPubScreen

    NAME
	LockPubScreen -- Prevent a public screen from closing. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	screen = LockPubScreen( Name )
	D0                      A0

	struct Screen *LockPubScreen( UBYTE * );

    FUNCTION
	Prevents a public screen (or the Workbench) from closing
	while you examine it in preparation of opening a visitor window.

	The sequence you use to open a visitor window that needs to
	examine fields in the screen it is about to open on is:
		LockPubScreen()
		... examine fields ...
		OpenWindow() on public screen
		UnlockPubScreen()
		... use your window ...
		CloseWindow()

    NOTE 
	You needn't hold the "pubscreen lock" for the duration that
	your window is opened.  LockPubScreen() basically has the
	same effect as an open visitor window: it prevents the
	screen from being closed.

	If you pass the string "Workbench" or you pass NULL and there
	is no default public screen, the Workbench screen will
	be automatically opened if it is not already present.

    INPUTS
	Name = name string for public screen or NULL for default public
	screen.  The string "Workbench" indicates the Workbench
	screen.

    RESULT
	Returns pointer to a screen, if successful, else NULL.
	The call can fail for reasons including that the named
	public screen doesn't exist or is in private state.

    SYNOPSIS
	List = LockPubScreenList()
	D0

	struct List *LockPubScreenList( VOID );

    FUNCTION
	Arbitrates access to public screen list	while you quickly
	make a copy of it for display to the user.

	Note that this is intended only for the Public Screen Manager
	program.

    NOTES
	The nodes on the list are PubScreenNode structures.
	Act quickly while holding this lock.  The restrictions
	on LockIBase() apply here as well.

    INPUTS
	None.

    RESULT
	A pointer to the public screen list.

    NAME
	MakeClass -- Create and initialize a boopsi class. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	iclass = MakeClass( ClassID, SuperClassID, SuperClassPtr,
	D0                  A0       A1            A2
		InstanceSize, Flags )
	        D0            D1

	struct IClass *MakeClass( UBYTE *, UBYTE *, struct IClass *,
		UWORD, ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	For class implementors only.
	
	This function creates a new public or private boopsi class.
	The superclass should be defined to be another boopsi class:
	all classes are descendants of the class "rootclass".

	Superclasses can be public or private.  You provide a name/ID
	for your class if it is to be a public class (but you must
	have registered your class name and your attribute ID's with
	Commodore before you do this!).  For a public class, you would
	also call AddClass() to make it available after you have
	finished your initialization.

	Returns pointer to an IClass data structure for your
	class.  You then initialize the Hook cl_Dispatcher for
	your class methods code.  You can also set up special data
	shared by all objects in your class, and point cl_UserData at it. 
	The last step for public classes is to call AddClass().

	You dispose of a class created by this function by calling
	FreeClass().

    INPUTS
	ClassID = NULL for private classes, the name/ID string for public
		classes
	SuperClassID = name/ID of your new class's superclass.  NULL if
		superclass is a private class
	SuperClassPtr = pointer to private superclass.  Only used if
		SuperClassID is NULL.  You are required never to provide
		a NULL superclass.
	InstanceSize = the size of the instance data that your class's
		objects will require, beyond that data defined for
		your superclass's objects.
	Flags = for future enhancement, including possible additional
		parameters.  Provide zero for now.

    RESULT
	Pointer to the resulting class, or NULL if not possible:
	- no memory for class data structure
	- public superclass not found
	- public class of same name/ID as this one already exists
	
    NOTES

    EXAMPLE
	Creating a private subclass of a public class:

    /* per-object instance data defined by my class	*/
    struct MyInstanceData {
	ULONG	mid_SomeData;
    };

    /* some useful table I'll share use for all objects */
    UWORD myTable[] = {
	5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
    };

    struct IClass	*
    initMyClass()
    {
	ULONG __saveds	myDispatcher();
	ULONG	hookEntry();	/* asm-to-C interface glue	*/
	struct IClass	*cl;
	struct IClass	*MakeClass();

	if ( cl =  MakeClass( NULL, 
		    SUPERCLASSID, NULL,		/* superclass is public      */
		    sizeof (struct MyInstanceData),
		    0 ))
	{
	    /* initialize the cl_Dispatcher Hook	*/
	    cl->cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry = hookEntry;
	    cl->cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry = myDispatcher;
	    cl->cl_Dispatcher.h_Data = (VOID *) 0xFACE;	/* unused */

	    cl-cl_UserData = (ULONG) myTable;
	}
	return ( cl );
    }

    BUGS
	The typedef 'Class' isn't consistently used.  Class pointers
	used blindly should be APTR, or struct IClass for class implementors.

intuition.library/MakeScreen                     intuition.library/MakeScreen

    NAME
	MakeScreen -- Do an Intuition-integrated MakeVPort() of a screen.

    SYNOPSIS
	failure = MakeScreen( Screen )
	D0 (V39)              A0

	LONG MakeScreen( struct Screen * );
	/* Returns LONG in V39 and greater */

    FUNCTION
	This procedure allows you to do a MakeVPort() for the viewport of your
	custom screen in an Intuition-integrated way.  This way you can
	do your own screen manipulations without worrying about interference
	with Intuition's usage of the same viewport.

	The operation of this function is as follows:
	    - Block until the Intuition View structure is not in being changed.
	    - Set the view modes correctly to reflect if there is a (visible)
	      interlaced screen.
	    - call MakeVPort(), passing the Intuition View and your screen's
	      ViewPort.
	    - Unlocks the Intuition View.

	After calling this routine, you should call RethinkDisplay() to 
	incorporate the new viewport of your custom screen into the 
	Intuition display.

	NOTE: Intuition may determine that because of a change in global
	interlace needs that all viewports need to be remade, so
	it may effectively call RemakeDisplay().

    INPUTS
	Screen = address of the custom screen structure

    RESULT
	Starting with V39, returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
	Probable cause of failure is failure of graphics.library/MakeVPort().
	Prior to V39, the return code is invalid.  Do not interpret it when
	running on pre-V39 systems!

intuition.library/ModifyIDCMP                   intuition.library/ModifyIDCMP

    NAME
	ModifyIDCMP -- Modify the state of a window's IDCMPFlags.

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = ModifyIDCMP( Window, IDCMPFlags )
	D0 (V37)               A0      D0

	BOOL ModifyIDCMP( struct Window *, ULONG );
	/* returns BOOL in V37 and greater */

    FUNCTION
	This routine modifies the state of your window's IDCMP (Intuition
	Direct Communication Message Port).  The state is modified to reflect
	your desires as described by the flag bits in the value IDCMPFlags.

	The four actions that might be taken are:

       - if there is currently no IDCMP in the given window, and IDCMPFlags
         is zero, nothing happens
       - if there is currently no IDCMP in the given window, and any of the
         IDCMPFlags is selected (set), then the IDCMP of the window is
         created, including allocating and initializing the message ports
         and allocating a signal bit for your port.  See the "Input and
         Output Methods" chapter of the Intuition Reference Manual for full
	  details
       - if the IDCMP for the given window exists, and the 
         IDCMPFlags argument is zero, this says that you want 
         Intuition to close the ports, free the buffers and free 
         your signal bit.  You MUST be the same task that was active 
         when this signal bit was allocated (either by ModifyIDCMP()
	  or OpenWindow() ).
       - if the IDCMP for the given window is opened, and the IDCMPFlags
         argument is not zero, this means that you want to change the 
         state of which events will be broadcast to you through the IDCMP

	NOTE:  You can set up the Window->UserPort to any port of your own
	before you call ModifyIDCMP().  If IDCMPFlags is non-null but 
	your UserPort is already initialized, Intuition will assume that 
	it's a valid port with task and signal data preset and Intuition 
	won't disturb your set-up at all, Intuition will just allocate 
	the Intuition message port half of it.  The converse is true 
	as well:  if UserPort is NULL when you call here with 
	IDCMPFlags == NULL, Intuition will deallocate only the Intuition
	side of the port.  

	This allows you to use a port that you already have allocated:  
       - OpenWindow() with IDCMPFlags equal to NULL (open no ports)
       - set the UserPort variable of your window to any valid port of your
         own choosing
       - call ModifyIDCMP with IDCMPFlags set to what you want
       - then, to clean up later, set UserPort equal to NULL before calling
         CloseWindow() (leave IDCMPFlags alone)  BUT FIRST: you must make
	  sure that no messages sent your window are queued at the port,
	  since they will be returned to the memory free pool.

	For an example of how to close a window with a shared IDCMP,
	see the description for CloseWindow().


    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the Window structure containing the IDCMP ports
	IDCMPFlags = the flag bits describing the new desired state of
		the IDCMP.  The flags are:

	    - IDCMP_REQVERIFY is the flag which, like IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY and ...

	    - IDCMP_MENUVERIFY (see immediately below), specifies that you
	      want to make sure that your graphical state is quiescent
	      before something extraordinary happens.  In this case, the
	      extraordinary event is that a rectangle of graphical data is
	      about to be blasted into your Window.  If you're drawing
	      directly into its screen, you probably will wish to make sure
	      that you've ceased drawing before the user is allowed to bring
	      up the DMRequest you've set up, and the same for when system
	      has a request for the user.  Set this flag to ask for that
	      verification step.

	    - IDCMP_REQCLEAR is the flag you set to hear a message whenever
	      a requester is cleared from your window.  If you are using
	      IDCMP_REQVERIFY to arbitrate access to your screen's bitmap, it
	      is safe to start your output once you have heard an
	      IDCMP_REQCLEAR for each IDCMP_REQSET.

	    - IDCMP_REQSET is a flag that you set to receive a broadcast
	      for each requester that is opened in your window.  Compare
	      this with IDCMP_REQCLEAR above.  This function is distinct
	      from IDCMP_REQVERIFY.  This functions merely tells you that a
	      requester has opened, whereas IDCMP_REQVERIFY requires you to
	      respond before the requester is opened.

	    - IDCMP_MENUVERIFY is the flag you set to have Intuition stop
	      and wait for you to finish all graphical output to your
	      window before rendering the menus.  Menus are currently
	      rendered in the most memory-efficient way, which involves
	      interrupting output to all windows in the screen before the
	      menus are drawn.  If you need to finish your graphical
	      output before this happens, you can set this flag to make
	      sure that you do.

	    - IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY means that you will be doing output to your
	      window which depends on a knowledge of the current size of the
	      window.  If the user wants to resize the window,  you may want
	      to make sure that any queued output completes before the sizing
	      takes place (critical text, for instance).  If this is the
	      case, set this flag.   Then, when the user wants to size,
	      Intuition will send you the IDCMP_SIZEVERIFY message and Wait()
	      until you reply that it's OK to proceed with the sizing. NOTE:
	      when we say that Intuition will Wait() until you reply, what
	      we're really saying is that user will WAIT until you reply, which
	      suffers the great negative potential of User-Unfriendliness.
	      So remember:  use this flag sparingly, and, as always with any
	      IDCMP Message you receive, reply to it promptly!  Then, after
	      user has sized the window, you can find out about it using
	      IDCMP_NEWSIZE.

	    With all the "VERIFY" functions, it is not save to leave them
	    enabled at any time when your task may not be able to respond
	    for a long period.

	    It is NEVER safe to call AmigaDOS, directly or indirectly, when
	    a "VERIFY" function is active.  If AmigaDOS needs to put up a
	    disk requester for you, your task might end up waiting for the
	    requester to be satisfied, at the same time as Intuition is
	    waiting for your response.  The result is a complete machine
	    lockup.  USE ModifyIDCMP() TO TURN OFF ANY VERIFY MESSAGES
	    BEFORE CALLING dos.library!!

	    For V36: If you do not respond to the verification IntuiMessages
	    within the user specified timeout duration, Intuition will abort
	    the operation.  This eliminates the threat of these easy
	    deadlocks, but can result in a confused user.  Please try
	    hard to continue to avoid "logical deadlocks".

	    - IDCMP_NEWSIZE is the flag that tells Intuition to send an IDCMP
	      message to you after the user has resized your window.  At
	      this point, you could examine the size variables in your
	      window structure to discover the new size of the window.
	      See also the IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP flag.

	    - IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW when set will cause a message to be sent
	      whenever your window needs refreshing.  This flag makes
	      sense only with WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH and WFLG_SMART_REFRESH
	      windows.

	    - IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS will get reports about mouse-button up/down
	      events broadcast to you (Note:  only the ones that
	      don't mean something to Intuition.  If the user clicks the
	      select button over a gadget, Intuition deals with it and you
	      don't find out about it through here).

	    - IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE will work only if you've set the 
	      WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag above, or if one of your gadgets has the
	      GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE flag set.  Then all mouse movements will be
	      reported here, providing your window is active.

	    - IDCMP_GADGETDOWN means that when the User "selects" a gadget
	      you've created with the GACT_IMMEDIATE flag set, the fact
	      will be broadcast through the IDCMP.

	    - IDCMP_GADGETUP means that when the user "releases" a gadget that
	      you've created with the GACT_RELVERIFY flag set, the fact
	      will be broadcast through the IDCMP.  This message is
	      only generated if the release is "good", such as releasing
	      the select button over a Boolean gadget, or typing ENTER
	      in a string gadget.

	    - IDCMP_MENUPICK selects that menu number data will be sent via
	      the IDCMP.

	    - IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW means broadcast the IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW event
	      through the IDCMP rather than the console.

	    - IDCMP_RAWKEY selects that all IDCMP_RAWKEY events are
	      transmitted via the IDCMP.  Note that these are absolutely RAW
	      keycodes, which you will have to translate before using.
	      Setting this and the MOUSE flags effectively eliminates the need
	      to open a Console device to get input from the keyboard and
	      mouse.  Of course, in exchange you lose all of the console
	      features, most notably the "cooking" of input data and
	      the systematic output of text to your window.

	    - IDCMP_VANILLAKEY is for developers who don't want the hassle
	      of IDCMP_RAWKEYS.  This flag will return all the keycodes after
	      translation via the current country-dependent keymap.  When
	      you set this flag, you will get IntuiMessages where the Code
	      field has a decoded ANSI character code representing the key
	      struck on the keyboard.  Only codes that map to a single
	      character are returned: you can't read such keys as HELP or
	      the function keys with IDCMP_VANILLAKEY.

	      NEW FOR V36: If you have both IDCMP_RAWKEY and IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
	      set, Intuition will send an IDCMP_RAWKEY event for those
	      *downstrokes* which do not map to single-byte characters
	      ("non-vanilla" keys).  In this way you can easily detect cursor
	      keys, function keys, and the Help key without sacrificing the
	      convenience of IDCMP_VANILLAKEY.  NB: A side-effect of having
	      both IDCMP_RAWKEY and IDCMP_VANILLAKEY set is that you never
	      hear IDCMP_RAWKEY upstrokes, even for keys that caused
	      IDCMP_RAWKEY downstrokes.

	    - IDCMP_INTUITICKS gives you simple timer events from Intuition
	      when your window is the active one; it may help you avoid
	      opening and managing the timer device.  With this flag set,
	      you will get only one queued-up INTUITICKS message at a
	      time.  If Intuition notices that you've been sent an
	      IDCMP_INTUITICKS message and haven't replied to it, another
	      message will not be sent.  Intuition receives timer events and
	      considers sending you an IDCMP_INTUITICKS message approximately
	      ten times a second.

	    - IDCMP_DELTAMOVE gives raw (unscaled) input event delta X/Y
	      values.  This is so you can detect mouse motion regardless of
	      screen/window/display boundaries.  This works a little
	      strangely: if you set both IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and IDCMP_DELTAMOVE.
	      IDCMPFlags, you will get IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE messages with delta
	      x/y values in the MouseX and MouseY fields of the
	      IDCMPMessage.

	    - IDCMP_NEWPREFS indicates you wish to be notified when the
	      system-wide Preferences changes.  For V36, there is a new
	      environment mechanism to replace Preferences, which we
	      recommend you consider using instead.

	    - Set IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW and IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW to get messages
	      when those events happen to your window.  Take care not to
	      confuse this "ACTIVEWINDOW" with the familiar sounding, but
	      totally different "WINDOWACTIVE" flag.  These two flags have
	      been supplanted by "IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW" and "WFLG_WINDOWACTIVE".
	      Use the new equivalent terms to avoid confusion.

	    - Set IDCMP_DISKINSERTED or IDCMP_DISKREMOVED to learn when
	      removable disks are inserted or removed, respectively.

	    - IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE is a new class for V36 which is used as
	      a channel of communication from custom and boopsi gadgets
	      to your application.

	    - IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW is a new class for V36 that will be sent
	      to your window whenever its dimensions or position are changed
	      by the user or the functions SizeWindow(), MoveWindow(),
	      ChangeWindowBox(), or ZipWindow().

	    - IDCMP_MENUHELP is new for V37.  If you specify the WA_MenuHelp
	      tag when you open your window, then when the user presses the
	      HELP key on the keyboard during a menu session, Intuition will
	      terminate the menu session and issue this even in place of an
	      IDCMP_MENUPICK message.
		- NEVER follow the NextSelect link for MENUHELP messages.
		- You will be able to hear MENUHELP for ghosted menus.
		  (This lets you tell the user why the option is ghosted.)
		- Be aware that you can receive a MENUHELP message whose code
		  corresponds to a menu header or an item that has sub-items
		  (which does not happen for MENUPICK).  The code may also be
		  MENUNULL.
		- LIMITATION:  if the user extend-selects some checkmarked
		  items with the mouse, then presses MENUHELP, your
		  application will only hear the MENUHELP report.  You
		  must re-examine the state of your checkmarks when you
		  get a MENUHELP.
		- Availability of MENUHELP in V36 is not directly
		  controllable.  We apologize...

	    - IDCMP_GADGETHELP is new for V39.  If you turn on
	      gadget help for your window (using the HelpControl())
	      function, then Intuition will send IDCMP_GADGETHELP
	      messages when the mouse passes over certain gadgets or
	      your window.  The IntuiMessage->Code field is normally
	      ~0, but a boopsi gadget can return any word value it wishes.

	      Ordinarily, gadget help is only processed for the active
	      window.  When Intuition has determined that the mouse is
	      pointing at a gadget which has the GMORE_GADGETHELP
	      property, you will be sent an IDCMP_GADGETHELP message
	      whose IAddress points to the gadget.  When the mouse is
	      over your window but not over any help-aware gadget, you
	      will be sent a message whose IAddress is the window
	      itself.  When the mouse is not over your window,
	      Intuition sends a message whose IAddress is zero.

	      A multi-window application can use the WA_HelpGroup or
	      WA_HelpGroupWindow tags to indicate that all its windows
	      belong in a group.  (The help group identifier should be
	      obtained with utility.library/GetUniqueID().) This makes
	      Intuition test gadget help in all windows of the group
	      when any one of them is the active one.  Inactive windows
	      whose WA_HelpGroup matches the active window's receive
	      IDCMP_GADGETHELP messages when the mouse is over that
	      window or any of its help-aware gadgets.  The GADGETHELP
	      message with an IAddress of zero means the mouse is not
	      over the active window or any other window of the same
	      group.  It is always sent to the active window (which is
	      not necessarily the window in your group that last got a
	      message).

	      To maximize performance, gadget help is not checked
	      while the mouse is travelling quickly, or if it has not
	      moved at all since the last test.  As well, if Intuition
	      discovers that the mouse is still over same gadget and
	      that gadget does not wish to send a different
	      IntuiMessage->Code from the last message, no new
	      IntuiMessage is sent.

    RESULT
	Starting in V37, this function returns NULL if it was unable
	to create the necessary message ports.  (The possibility of
	failure exists in earlier releases, but no return code was offered).
	Do not check the return code under V36 or earlier.

    NAME
	ModifyProp -- Modify the current parameters of a proportional gadget.

    SYNOPSIS
	ModifyProp( Gadget, Window, Requester, 
		    A0	    A1	    A2
           	    Flags, HorizPot, VertPot, HorizBody, VertBody )
		    D0	   D1	     D2	      D3	 D4

	VOID ModifyProp( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester *, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	Modifies the parameters of the specified proportional gadget.  The 
	gadget's internal state is then recalculated and the imagery 
	is redisplayed in the window or requester that contains the gadget.

	The requester variable can point to a requester structure.  If the 
	gadget has the GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, the gadget is in a requester 
	and the window pointer must point to the window of the requester.
	If this is not the gadget of a requester, the requester argument may
	be NULL.

	NOTE: this function causes all gadgets from the proportional
	gadget to the end of the gadget list to be refreshed, for
	reasons of compatibility.
	For more refined display updating, use NewModifyProp().

	New for V36: ModifyProp() refreshing consists of redrawing gadgets
	completely.  NewModifyProp() has changed this behavior (see 
	NewModifyProp()).
   
    INPUTS
	PropGadget = pointer to a proportional gadget
	Window = pointer to the window containing the gadget or the window
	    containing the requester containing the gadget.
	Requester = pointer to a requester (may be NULL if this isn't 
	    a requester gadget)
	Flags = value to be stored in the Flags field of the PropInfo
	HorizPot = value to be stored in the HorizPot field of the PropInfo
	VertPot = value to be stored in the VertPot field of the PropInfo

    NAME
	MoveScreen -- Attempt to move the screen by the increments provided.

    SYNOPSIS
	MoveScreen( Screen, DeltaX, DeltaY )
		    A0      D0      D1

	VOID MoveScreen( struct Screen *, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	Moves the screen the specified increment, specified in screen
	pixel resolution coordinates.

	New for V36: Screen movement limits have been greatly relaxed,
	to support screen scrolling.  In particular, negative values
	for screen LeftEdge and TopEdge may now be valid.

       If the DeltaX and DeltaY variables you specify would move the screen
       in a way that violates any restrictions, the screen will be moved
       as far as possible.  You may examine the LeftEdge and TopEdge fields
	of the Screen structure after this function returns to see where
	the screen really ended up.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to a Screen structure
	DeltaX = amount to move the screen on the x-axis
		Note that DeltaX no longer (V36) need be set to zero
	DeltaY = amount to move the screen on the y-axis
		Note that these coordinates are in the same resolution
		as the screen (such as HIRES or INTERLACE)

    SYNOPSIS
	MoveWindow( Window, DeltaX, DeltaY )
		    A0      D0      D1

	VOID MoveWindow( struct Window *, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	This routine sends a request to Intuition asking to move the window 
	the specified distance.  The delta arguments describe how far to 
	move the window along the respective axes.  

	Note that the window will not be moved immediately, but rather 
	will be moved the next time Intuition receives an input event, 
	which happens currently at a minimum rate of ten times per second,
	and a maximum of sixty times a second.  

	Interactions with other arbitration of Intuition data structures
	may defer this operation longer.  For V36, you can use the new
	IDCMP class IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW to detect when this operation has
	completed.

	New for V36: Intuition now will do validity checking on the final
	position.  To send absolute movements, or to move and size a
	window in one step, use ChangeWindowBox().

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the structure of the Window to be moved
	DeltaX = how far to move the Window on the x-axis
	DeltaY = how far to move the Window on the y-axis

    RESULT

    FUNCTION
	Performs the function of ModifyProp(), but refreshes
	gadgets in the list as specified by the NumGad parameter. 
	With NumGad = -1, this function is identical to ModifyProp().

	New for V36: When NumGad = 1, this function will now perform
	an incremental update of the proportional gadget knob image,
	rather than refreshing the entire gadget.  This means much
	less flashing when programmatically scrolling a proportional
	gadget.
   
    INPUTS
	PropGadget = pointer to a proportional gadget
	Window = pointer to the window containing the gadget or the window
	    containing the requester containing the gadget.

    NAME
	NewObjectA -- Create an object from a class. (V36)
	NewObject -- Varargs stub for NewObjectA(). (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	object = NewObjectA( class, classID, tagList )
	D0                   A0     A1       A2

	APTR NewObjectA( struct IClass *, UBYTE *, struct TagItem * );

	object = NewObject( class, classID, Tag1, ... )

	APTR NewObject( struct IClass *, UBYTE *, ULONG, ... );

    FUNCTION
	This is the general method of creating objects from 'boopsi' classes.
	('Boopsi' stands for "basic object-oriented programming system for
	Intuition".)

	You specify a class either as a pointer (for a private class) or
	by its ID string (for public classes).  If the class pointer
	is NULL, then the classID is used.

	You further specify initial "create-time" attributes for the
	object via a TagItem list, and they are applied to the resulting
	generic data object that is returned.  The attributes, their meanings,
	attributes applied only at create-time, and required attributes
	are all defined and documented on a class-by-class basis.
	
    INPUTS
	class = abstract pointer to a boopsi class gotten via MakeClass().
	classID = the name/ID string of a public class.  This parameter is
		only used if 'class' is NULL.
	tagList = pointer to array of TagItems containing attribute/value
		pairs to be applied to the object being created

    RESULT
	A boopsi object, which may be used in different contexts such
	as a gadget or image, and may be manipulated by generic functions.
	You eventually free the object using DisposeObject().
	
    NOTES
	This function invokes the OM_NEW "method" for the class specified.

    BUGS
	Typedef's for 'Object' and 'Class' are defined in the include
	files but not used consistently.  The generic type APTR is
	probably best used for object and class "handles", with the
	type (UBYTE *) used for classID strings.

    SYNOPSIS
	object = NextObject( objectPtrPtr )
	D0                   A0

	APTR NextObject( APTR );

    FUNCTION
	This function is for boopsi class implementors only.

	When you collect a set of boopsi objects on an Exec List
	structure by invoking their OM_ADDMEMBER method, you
	can (only) retrieve them by iterations of this function.

	Works even if you remove and dispose the returned list
	members in turn.

    INPUTS
	Initially, you set a pointer variable to equal the
	lh_Head field of the list (or mlh_Head field of a MinList).
	You pass the *address* of that pointer repeatedly
	to NextObject() until it returns NULL.
	
    EXAMPLE

	/* here is the OM_DISPOSE case of some class's dispatcher */
	case OM_DISPOSE:
	    /* dispose members	*/
	    object_state = mydata->md_CollectionList.lh_Head;
	    while ( member_object = NextObject( &object_state ) )
	    {
		DoMethod( member_object, OM_REMOVE ); /* remove from list */
		DoMethodA( member, msg );	/* and pass along dispose	*/
	    }

    RESULT
	Returns pointers to each object in the list in turn, and NULL
	when there are no more.

intuition.library/NextPubScreen               intuition.library/NextPubScreen

    NAME
	NextPubScreen -- Identify next public screen in the cycle. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	Buff = NextPubScreen( Screen, NameBuff )
	D0                    A0      A1

	UBYTE *NextPubScreen( struct Screen *, UBYTE * );

    FUNCTION
	Returns name of next public screen in system rotation, to
	allow visitor windows to provide function to "jump" among
	public-screens in a cycle.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to the screen your window is currently open in,
	  or NULL, if you don't have a pointer to a public screen.
	NameBuff = pointer to a buffer of MAXPUBSCREENNAME+1 characters,
	  for Intuition to fill in with the name of the next public
	  screen in rotation.

    RESULT
	Returns NULL if there are no public screens, otherwise a
	pointer to your NameBuff.

    NOTES
	There is no guarantee that the public screen whose name
	was returned by this function will exist or be in "public" state
	by the time you call LockPubScreen(), etc.  You must handle
	cases where LockPubScreen(), etc. will fail.

	Note that this function may return the name of a public screen
	which is open but in "private mode" (see PubScreenStatus() and
	PSNF_PRIVATE).

    BUGS
	Due to a bug, your buffer needs to be (MAXPUBSCREENNAME + 1)
	characters big, which is one more than originally documented.

	The starting screen and cycle order of the public screens isn't
	defined, so do not draw conclusions about the order you
	see in the current version of Intuition.  We reserve the
	right to add meaning to the ordering at a future time.

    FUNCTION
	Sets up a RastPort for use (only) by custom gadget hook routines.
	This function must be called EACH time a hook routine needing
	to perform gadget rendering is called, and must be accompanied
	by a corresponding call to ReleaseGIRPort().

	Note that if a hook function passes you a RastPort pointer,
	e.g., GM_RENDER, you needn't call ObtainGIRPort() in that case.

    INPUTS
	A pointer to a GadgetInfo structure, as passed to each custom
	gadget hook function.

    RESULT
	A pointer to a RastPort that may be used for gadget rendering.
	This pointer may be NULL, in which case you should do no rendering.

    FUNCTION
	This command disables the specified gadget.  When a gadget is
	disabled, these things happen:
	     - its imagery is displayed ghosted
	     - the GFLG_DISABLED flag is set
	     - the gadget cannot be selected by User

	The window parameter must point to the window which contains the
	gadget, or which contains the requester that contains the gadget.
	The requester parameter must only be valid if the gadget has the
	GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, a requirement for all requester gadgets.

       NOTE:  it's never safe to tinker with the gadget list yourself.  Don't
       supply some gadget that Intuition hasn't already processed in
       the usual way.

    	NOTE: for compatibility reasons, this function will refresh all
	gadgets in a requester, and all gadgets from gadget to the 
	end of the gadget list if gadget is in a window.

	If you want to improve on this behavior, you may perform the
	equivalent operation yourself: remove a gadget or gadgets,

           a requester gadget (i.e. GTYP_REQGADGET is not set)).

    RESULT
	None

    BUGS
	Traditional gadgets are rendered very simply.  This can result
	in incomplete clearing away of the ghosting pattern when
	OnGadget() is used.  For example, a button whose imagery consists
	of an IntuiText inside a rectangular Border doesn't have the
	button interior cleared by OnGadget().  This is because OnGadget()
	clears the GFLG_DISABLED flag then redraws the gadget.  Redrawing
	this gadget consists of redrawing the border and text.  Nothing
	redraws the field.

	The solution to this type of problem is to either use a gadget
	whose imagery is a struct Image that covers the whole select area,
	or to manually remove the gadget, erase the gadget's select area
	(say using EraseRect()), then clear the GFLG_DISABLED flag,
	add the gadget back to the window, and refresh it.

    FUNCTION
	Opens an Intuition screen according to the specified parameters
	found in the NewScreen structure.

	Does all the allocations, sets up the screen structure and all
	substructures completely, and links this screen's viewport into 
	Intuition's View structure.

	Before you call OpenScreen(), you must initialize an instance of
	a NewScreen structure.  NewScreen is a structure that contains
	all of the arguments needed to open a screen.  The NewScreen
	structure may be discarded immediately after OpenScreen() returns.

	The SHOWTITLE flag is set to TRUE by default when a screen is opened.
	To change this, you must call the routine ShowTitle().

    INPUTS
	NewScreen = pointer to an instance of a NewScreen structure.

	In addition to the information contained in the NewScreen structure,
	Intuition now recognizes extended data passed in the form
	of an array of TagItem structures (from <utility/tagitem.h>),
	commonly called a "tag list."

	There are two ways to provide this array.  The first is to 
	use the new Intuition entry point OpenScreenTagList() and 
	pass the tag list as a parameter.  This is the recommended
	method, and has a convenient format variation for C programs
	using a variable number of arguments.

	An older way used for some V36 development uses the OpenScreen()
	entry point, and an extension of the NewScreen structure named
	ExtNewScreen.  See the documentation of the flag NS_EXTENDED,
	below.

	While we recommend that you use OpenScreenTagList() rather than
	OpenScreen() when using the extension tag list, we document
	the tag ID values here, so that all parameters for opening
	a screen can be found in one place.

	NewScreen is initialized with the following information:
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	Left = initial x-position of your screen (should be zero for
	releases prior to V36)

	Top = initial y-position of the opening screen
	(Note: Left and Top are specified relative to the Intuition's view,
	in same resolution as the screen pixels.)

	Width = the width for this screen's RastPort

	Height = the height for this screen's RastPort, or the constant
		STDSCREENHEIGHT to get the current default height (at
		this time guaranteed to be at least 200 rows).  The normal
		width and height for a particular system is stored by
		the graphics.library in GfxBase->NormalDisplayRows and
		GfxBase->NormalDisplayColumns.  These values will be different
		depending on factors such as PAL video and overscan.

		For V36, a new constant STDSCREENWIDTH is introduced.  It
		serves the similar function for screen width.  Both
		STDSCREENWIDTH and STDSCREENHEIGHT indicate that your
		screen RastPort is to be the same dimensions as your
		DisplayClip rectangle.  If you do not specify either a
		standard or custom DisplayClip, the OSCAN_TEXT region
		will be used, which corresponds to the standard dimensions
		of V35 and earlier.

		Furthermore, if you are using OpenScreenTagList(), and you
		specify STDSCREENWIDTH, and you DO NOT provide a NewScreen
		pointer, and you DO NOT provide sA_Left, then Intuition
		will automatically set the LeftEdge of the screen to
		be the left edge of the screen's DisplayClip region.
		Likewise for STDSCREENHEIGHT and the screen's TopEdge.

	Depth = number of bitplanes

	DetailPen = pen number for details (like gadgets or text in title bar)
	    The common value for this pen is 0.

	BlockPen = pen number for block fills (like title bar)
	    The common value for this pen is 1.

	Type = screen type values
	    Set these flags as desired from the set:
	    CUSTOMSCREEN -- this is your own screen, not a system screen.
	    CUSTOMBITMAP -- this custom screen has bit maps supplied
		in the bitmap field of the NewScreen structure.  Intuition is
		not to allocate any raster bitmaps.
	    SCREENBEHIND -- your screen will be created behind all other open
		screens.  This allows a program to prepare imagery in the
		screen, change its colors, and so on, bringing it to the
		front when it is presentable.
	    SCREENQUIET -- Intuition will not render system screen gadgets or
		screen title.  In concert with the WFLG_RMBTRAP flag on all
		your screen's windows, this flag will prevent Intuition from
		rendering into your screen's bitplanes.  Without WFLG_RMBTRAP
		(or using the IDCMP_MENUVERIFY facility to cancel menu
		operations), this flag will prevent Intuition from clearing
		your menu bar, which is probably unacceptable.  The menu bar
		layer may still overwrite  a portion of your screen bitmap
		when the screen is opened.  (V36: it won't clobber your bits
		any more.)
	    NS_EXTENDED for this screen to use extended attributes pointed
		to by the 'Extended' field, below.

	ViewModes = the appropriate argument for the data type ViewPort.Modes.
           These include:
           HIRES for this screen to be HIRES width.
           LACE for the display to switch to interlace.
           SPRITES for this screen to use sprites (the pointer
		sprite is always displayed)
           DUALPF for dual-playfield mode (not supported yet)
	    [For V36: The ViewModes field is superseded by a TagItem with
	    tag value SA_DisplayID.]

	Font = pointer to the default TextAttr structure for text in this 
	    screen and all windows that open in this screen.  Text that uses
	    this TextAttr includes title bars of both screen and windows,
	    string gadgets, and menu titles.  Of course, IntuiText that
	    specifies a NULL TextAttr field will use the screen/window default
	    fonts.  NOTE: Intuition will *NOT* call OpenDiskFont(), so
	    the TextAttr you supply must be in memory.  The ways to ensure
	    that are to either use a ROM font (Topaz 8 or 9) or first
	    call OpenDiskFont() to load the font, and don't close it
	    until after your screen is successfully opened.
	    [For V36: this is superseded by SA_Font and SA_SysFont.]

	DefaultTitle = pointer to a line of text that will be displayed along
	    the screen's title bar.  Null terminated, or just a NULL pointer
           to get no text
	    [For V36: superseded by SA_Title.]

	Gadgets = This field should be set to NULL, since no user gadgets may
	    be attached to a screen with the current versions of Intuition.

	CustomBitMap = if you're not supplying a custom bitmap, this value is 
           ignored.  However, if you have your own display memory that you
           want used for this screen, the CustomBitMap field should point to
	    the BitMap structure that describes your display memory.  See the
           "Screens" chapter and the "Amiga ROM Kernel Manual" for more 
           information about bitmaps.
	    [For V36: this is superseded by SA_BitMap.]

	[ All TagItem extensions below are new for V36.]
	Extension = if NS_EXTENDED is set in NewScreen.Type, this pointer
	    should point to an array (or chain of arrays) of TagItems,
	    as defined in the include file <utility/tagitem.h>.   This
	    field is only defined in the structure ExtNewScreen.
	    The values to use for TagItem.ti_Tag are defined below.  We
	    recommend that V36-specific applications use the new Intuition
	    entry point OpenScreenTagList(), rather than using this field.
	    The ExtNewScreen structure is a convenient way to give V36
	    Intuition some information that V34 and earlier Intuition will
	    ignore.

	    Each TagItem is an optional tagged data structure which identifies
	    an additional parameter to OpenScreen().  The applicable tag ID
	    values for TagItem.ti_Tag and their corresponding data follow.

	    Several of the tag items are alternative (and overriding) versions
	    to familiar fields in NewScreen.  (Defaults only apply if 
	    NewScreen == NULL).  They are:

	SA_Left
	SA_Top
	SA_Width
	SA_Height
	    The defaults for the SA_Left, SA_Top, SA_Width, and
	    SA_Height tags end up being a bit complex.  If none of
	    these tags are specified, and no NewScreen structure is
	    used, then the left/top/width/height correctly match the
	    display clip of your screen (see SA_DClip and
	    SA_Overscan).

	    The difficulty comes with overscanned screens, because the
	    normal value of SA_Left or SA_Top for such a screen may be
	    non-zero.  If a NewScreen structure is supplied, then the
	    left/top/width/height come originally from there.  If no
	    NewScreen structure is supplied, but a non-default
	    SA_Width (SA_Height) is specified, then SA_Left (SA_Top)
	    defaults to zero instead.  In these cases, the left and
	    top edge may not be what you want.

	    If you need to specify explicit width or height, or supply
	    a NewScreen, you must supply correct values for SA_Left
	    and SA_Top.  The correct normal values are the display
	    clip rectangle's MinX and MinY values respectively.  If
	    you are using the SA_DClip tag, then you already have a
	    rectangle to consult for these values.  If you are using
	    SA_Overscan to get one of the standard overscan types, you
	    may use QueryOverscan() to get a rectangle for that
	    overscan type.

	SA_Depth (defaults to 1)
	SA_DetailPen (defaults to 0)
	SA_BlockPen (defaults to 1)
	SA_Title (defaults to NULL)
	SA_Font (defaults to NULL, meaning user's preferred monospace font)
	SA_BitMap (whose existence also implies CUSTOMBITMAP). 

	    Several tags are Booleans, which means that depending on whether
	    their corresponding ti_Data field is zero (FALSE) or non-zero
	    (TRUE), they specify Boolean attributes.  The ones corresponding
	    to Boolean flags in the NewScreen.Type field are:

	SA_ShowTitle (defaults to TRUE)
	SA_Behind (equiv. to SCREENBEHIND) (defaults to FALSE)
	SA_Quiet (equiv. to SCREENQUIET) (defaults to FALSE)

	    The following tags provide extended information to Intuition
	    when creating a screen:

	SA_Type: ti_Data corresponds to the SCREENTYPE bits of the
	    NewScreen.Type field.  This should be one of PUBLICSCREEN or
	    CUSTOMSCREEN.  The other bits of the NewScreen.Type field
	    must be set with the appropriate tags (SA_Behind, SA_Quiet,
	    etc.)

	SA_DisplayID: ti_Data is a 32-bit extended display mode ID, as
	  defined in the <graphics/modeid.h> include file (V39 and up)
	  or in <graphics/displayinfo.h> (V37 and V38).

	SA_Overscan: ti_Data contains a defined constant specifying
	    one of the system standard overscan dimensions appropriate for
	    the display mode of the screen.  Used with the Width and
	    Height dimensions STDSCREENWIDTH and STDSCREEN, this makes
	    it trivial to open an overscanned or standard dimension
	    screen.  You may also hand-pick your various dimensions
	    for overscanned or other screens, by specifying screen position
	    and dimensions explicitly, and by using SA_DClip to explicitly
	    specify an overscanned DisplayClip region.

	    The values for ti_Data of this tag are as follows:

	    OSCAN_TEXT - Text Overscan region.  A region which is completely
	    on screen and readable ("text safe").  A preferences data
	    setting, this is backward equivalent with the old MoreRows,
	    and specifies the DisplayClip and default dimensions of the
	    Workbench screen.  This is the default.

	    OSCAN_STANDARD - Also a preferences setting, this specifies
	    a rectangle whose edges are "just out of view."  This yields
	    the most efficient position and dimensions of on-monitor
	    presentations, such as games and artwork.

	    OSCAN_MAX - This is the largest rectangular region that the
	    graphics library can handle "comfortably" for a given mode.
	    Screens can smoothly scroll (hardware pan) within this region,
	    and any DisplayClip or Screen region within this rectangle
	    is also legal.  It is not a preferences item, but reflects
	    the limits of the graphics hardware and software.

	    OSCAN_VIDEO - This is the largest region that the graphics
	    library can display, comfortable or not.  There is no guarantee
	    that all smaller rectangles are valid.  This region is
	    typically out of sight on any monitor or TV, but provides our
	    best shot at "edge-to-edge" video generation.

	    Remember, using overscan drastically effects memory use and
	    chip memory bandwidth.  Always use the smallest (standard)
	    overscan region that works for your application.

	SA_DClip: ti_Data is a pointer to a rectangle which explicitly
	    defines a DisplayClip region for this screen.  See QueryOverscan()
	    for the role of the DisplayClip region.

	    Except for overscan display screens, this parameter is
	    unnecessary, and specifying a standard value using SA_Overscan
	    is normally an easier way to get overscan.

	SA_AutoScroll: this is a Boolean tag item, which specifies that
	    this screens is to scroll automatically when the mouse pointer
	    reaches the edge of the screen.  The operation of this requires
	    that the screen dimensions be larger than its DisplayClip
	    region.

	SA_PubName: If this field is present (and ti_Data is non-NULL),
	    it means that the screen is a public screen, and that
	    the public screen name string is pointed to by ti_Data.
	    Public screens are opened in "PRIVATE" mode and must
	    be made public using PubScreenStatus( screen, 0 ).

	SA_Pens: The ti_Data field (if non-NULL) points to a UWORD
	    array of pen specification, as defined for struct DrawInfo.
	    This array will be used to initialize the screen's
	    DrawInfo.dri_Pens array.

	    SA_Pens is also used to decide that a screen is ready
	    to support the full-blown "new look" graphics.  If you
	    want the 3D embossed look, you must provide this tag,
	    and the ti_Data value cannot be NULL.  If it points
	    to a "minimal" array, containing just the terminator ~0,
	    you can specify "new look" without providing any values
	    for the pen array.

	    The way the DrawInfo pens are determined is Intuition
	    picks a default pen-array.  Then, any pens you supply with
	    SA_Pens override the defaults, up until the ~0 in your
	    array.

	    If the screen is monochrome or old-look, the default will
	    be the standard two-color pens.

	    If the screen is two or more planes deep, the default will
	    be the standard four-color pens, which now include the
	    new-look menu colors.

	    If the screen has the SA_LikeWorkbench property, the
	    default will be the user's preferred pen-array, changeable
	    through preferences.

	The following two tag items specify the task and signal to be issued
	to notify when the last "visitor" window closes on a public screen. 
	This support is to assist envisioned public screen manager programs.

	SA_PubTask:  Task to be signalled.  If absent (and SA_PubSig is
	    valid), use the task which called OpenScreen() or
	    OpenScreenTagList()).

	SA_PubSig:  Data is a UBYTE signal number (not flag) used to notify
	    a task when the last visitor window closes on a public screen.

	SA_Colors: ti_Data points to an array of ColorSpec structures
	    (terminated with ColorIndex = -1) which specify initial
	    values of the screen's color palette.

	SA_FullPalette: this is a Boolean attribute.  Prior to V36, there
	    were just 7 RGB color values that Intuition maintained
	    in its user preferences (playfield colors 0-3, and colors
	    17-19 for the sprite).  When opening a screen, the color
	    map for the screens viewport is first initialized by
	    graphics (graphics.library/GetColorMap()) then these
	    seven values are overridden to take the preferences values.

	    In V36, Intuition maintains a full set of 32 preferences colors.
	    If you specify TRUE for SA_FullPalette, Intuition will
	    override ALL color map entries with its full suite of
	    preferred colors.  (Defaults to FALSE).

	SA_ErrorCode: ti_Data points to a ULONG in which Intuition will
	    stick an extended error code if OpenScreen[TagList]() fails.
	    Values are of this include 0, for success, and:
	    OSERR_NOMONITOR	- monitor for display mode not available.
	    OSERR_NOCHIPS	- you need newer custom chips for display mode.
	    OSERR_NOMEM		- couldn't get normal memory
	    OSERR_NOCHIPMEM	- couldn't get chip memory
	    OSERR_PUBNOTUNIQUE	- public screen name already used
	    OSERR_UNKNOWNMODE	- don't recognize display mode requested
	    OSERR_TOODEEP	- screen too deep to be displayed on
				  this hardware (V39)
	    OSERR_ATTACHFAIL	- An illegal attachment of screens was
				  requested (V39)
	    
	    NOTE: These values are not the same as some similar return
	    values defined in graphics.library/ModeNotAvailable().

	SA_SysFont: ti_Data selects one of the system standard fonts
	    specified in preferences.  This tag item overrides the
	    NewScreen.Font field and the SA_Font tag item.

	    Values recognized in ti_Data at present are:
		0 - old DefaultFont, fixed-width, the default.
		1 - Workbench screen preferred font.  You have to
		    be very font sensitive to handle a proportional or
		    larger than traditional screen font.

	    NOTE WELL: if you select sysfont 1, windows opened on
	    your screen will not inherit the screen font, but rather
	    the window RastPort will be initialized to the old-style
	    DefaultFont (sysfont 0).

	Attached screen tags:  V39 supports attached screens, where
	    one or more child screens can be associated with a parent
	    screen.  Attached screens depth-arrange as a group, and
	    always remain adjacent depth-wise.  Independent
	    depth-arrangement of child screens is possible through
	    the V39 ScreenDepth() call.  If a child screen is
	    made non-draggable through {SA_Draggable, FALSE}, then
	    it will drag exclusively with the parent.  Normal child
	    screens drag independently of the parent, but are pulled
	    down when the parent is.  Use the SA_Parent, SA_FrontChild,
	    and SA_BackChild tags to attach screens.

	SA_Parent:  If you wish to attach this screen to an
	    already-open parent screen, use this tag and set
	    ti_Data to point to the parent screen.  See also
	    SA_FrontChild and SA_BackChild.  (V39).

	SA_FrontChild:  If you wish to attach an already-open child
	    screen to this screen, set ti_Data to point to the child
	    screen.  The child screen will come to the front of the
	    family defined by the parent screen you are opening.  See
	    also SA_Parent and SA_BackChild.  (V39)

	SA_BackChild:  If you wish to attach an already-open child
	    screen to this screen, set ti_Data to point to the child
	    screen.  The child screen will go to the back of the family
	    defined by the parent screen you are opening.  See also
	    SA_Parent and SA_FrontChild.  (V39)

	SA_BackFill:  ti_Data is a pointer to a backfill hook for
	    the screen's Layer_Info.
	    (see layers.library/InstallLayerInfoHook()).  (V39).

	SA_Draggable:  ti_Data is a boolean.  Set to FALSE if you
	    wish your screen to be non-draggable.  This tag should be
	    used very sparingly!.  Defaults to TRUE.  For child screens
	    (see SA_Parent, SA_FrontChild, and SA_BackChild) this tag
	    has a slightly different meaning:  non-draggable child
	    screens are non-draggable with respect to their parent,
	    meaning they always drag exactly with the parent, as
	    opposed to having relative freedom.  Also see
	    ScreenPosition().  (V39)

	SA_Exclusive:  ti_Data is a boolean.  Set to TRUE if you
	    never want your screen to share the display with another
	    screen.  This means that your screen can't be pulled down,
	    and will not appear behind other screens that are pulled
	    down.  Your screen may still be depth arranged, though.  Use
	    this tag sparingly!  Defaults to FALSE.  Starting with V40,
	    attached screens may be SA_Exclusive.  Setting SA_Exclusive
	    for each screen will produce an exclusive family.  (V39).

	SA_SharePens:  For those pens in the screen's
	    DrawInfo->dri_Pens, Intuition obtains them in shared mode
	    (see graphics.library/ObtainPen()).  For compatibility,
	    Intuition obtains the other pens of a public screen as
	    PENF_EXCLUSIVE.  Screens that wish to manage the pens
	    themselves should generally set this tag to TRUE.  This
	    instructs Intuition to leave the other pens unallocated.
	    Defaults to FALSE.  (V39).

	SA_Colors32:  Tag to set the screen's initial palette colors
	    at 32 bits-per-gun.  ti_Data is a pointer to a table to be
	    passed to the graphics.library/LoadRGB32() function.  This
	    format supports both runs of color registers and sparse
	    registers.  See the autodoc for that function for full
	    details.  Any color set here has precedence over the same
	    register set by SA_Colors.  (V39).

	SA_Interleaved:  ti_Data is a boolean.  Set to TRUE to
	    request an interleaved bitmap for your screen.  Defaults to
	    FALSE.  If the system cannot allocate an interleaved bitmap for
	    you, it will attempt to allocate a non-interleaved one (V39).

	SA_VideoControl:  ti_Data points to a taglist that will be
	    passed to VideoControl() after your screen is open.  You
	    might use this to turn on border-sprites, for example.
	    (V39).

	SA_ColorMapEntries:  ti_Data is the number of entries that
	    you wish Intuition to allocate for this screen's ColorMap.
	    While Intuition allocates a suitable number for ordinary
	    use, certain graphics.library features require a
	    ColorMap which is larger than default.  (The default value is
	    1<<depth, but not less than 32).  (V39)

	SA_LikeWorkbench:  ti_Data is boolean.  Set to TRUE to get
	    a screen just like the Workbench screen.  This is the
	    best way to inherit all the characteristics of the
	    Workbench, including depth, colors, pen-array, screen mode,
	    etc.  Individual attributes can be overridden through the
	    use of tags.  (SA_LikeWorkbench itself overrides things
	    specified in the NewScreen structure).  Attention
	    should be paid to hidden assumptions when doing this.  For
	    example, setting the depth to two makes assumptions about
	    the pen values in the DrawInfo pens.  Note that this
	    tag requests that Intuition ATTEMPT to open the screen
	    to match the Workbench.  There are fallbacks in case
	    that fails, so it is not correct to make enquiries about
	    the Workbench screen then make strong assumptions about
	    what you're going to get.  (Defaults to FALSE).  (V39)

 	SA_MinimizeISG:  ti_Data is boolean.  For compatibility,
	    Intuition always ensures that the inter-screen gap is at
	    least three non-interlaced lines.  If your application
	    would look best with the smallest possible inter-screen
	    gap, set ti_Data to TRUE.  If you use the new graphics
	    VideoControl() VC_NoColorPaletteLoad tag for your screen's
	    ViewPort, you should also set this tag.  (V40)


    RESULT
	If all is well, returns the pointer to your new screen
	If anything goes wrong, returns NULL, with further error
	specification in the variable pointed to by the SA_ErrorCode
	data field (V36 and later).

    NOTES
	By default, AmigaDOS requesters related to your process are put on
	the Workbench screen (these are messages like "Disk Full").  If
	you wish them to show up on custom screens, DOS must be told.
	This fragment shows the procedure.  More information is available
	in the AmigaDOS manuals.  Sample code fragment:

	#include "libraries/dosextens.h"
		...
	struct Process	*process;
	struct Window	*window;
	APTR		temp;
		...
		process = (struct Process *) FindTask(NULL);
		temp = process->pr_WindowPtr;	(save old value)
		process->pr_WindowPtr = (APTR) window;
		( use a pointer to any open window on your screen )
			...
		your code goes here
			...
		process->pr_WindowPtr = temp;
		( restore value BEFORE CloseWindow() )
		CloseWindow(window);

	A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE about the Screen->BitMap.  In the future,
	bitmaps will need to grow.  The embedded instance of a bitmap
	in the screen will no longer be large enough to hold the whole
	description of the bitmap.

	YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED to use Screen->RastPort.BitMap in place of
	&Screen->BitMap whenever and whereever possible.

   NAME	
	OpenScreenTagList -- OpenScreen() with TagItem extension array. (V36)
	OpenScreenTags -- Varargs stub for OpenScreenTagList. (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	Screen = OpenScreenTagList( NewScreen, TagItems )
	D0	  		    A0         A1

	struct Screen *OpenScreenTagList( struct NewScreen *,
		struct TagItem * );

	Screen = OpenScreenTags( NewScreen, Tag1, ... )

	struct Screen *OpenScreenTags( struct NewScreen *,
		ULONG, ... );

   FUNCTION
	Provides an extension to the parameters passed to OpenScreen().
	This extensions is in the form of (a pointer to) an array of
	TagItem structures, which have to fields: ti_Tag, an ID identifying
	the meaning of the other field, ti_Data.  See <utility/tagitem.h>.

	The tag items can supplement or override the values in NewScreen.
	In fact, you can pass a NULL value of the NewScreen pointer.
	For that matter, if you pass NULL in both arguments, you'll get
	a screen with defaults in all fields, including display mode,
	depth, colors, dimension, title, and so on.  We ask that
	you at least supply a title when you open a screen.

	See OpenScreen() documentation for parameter specifications.

   INPUTS
 	NewScreen     - (optional) pointer to a NewScreen structure.
 	TagItems      - (optional) pointer to (an array of) TagItem
			structures, terminated by the value TAG_END.

   RESULT
 	Screen	- an open Intuition screen.  See OpenScreen() for
		extended error codes when Screen is returned NULL.

   EXAMPLE
	The version using a variable number of arguments must be
	created for each particular compiler, and may not have
	an analogue in all versions.  For vanilla, 32-bit C
	parameter passing conventions, this works (and will
	appear in amiga.lib):
    
	struct Screen	*
	OpenScreenTags( ns, tag1 )
	struct NewScreen	*ns;
	ULONG			tag1;
	{
	    struct Screen	*OpenScreenTagList();

	    return ( OpenScreenTagList( ns, (struct TagItem *) &tag1 ) );
	}

   NOTES
	We recommend this extension to OpenScreen() over using the
	field ExtNewScreen.Extension.  However, the ExtNewScreen.Extension
	is a convenient way to supply a few tags to V36 Intuition which
	will be ignored by V34 Intuition.  See OpenScreen() documentation
	for lots of details.

	A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE about the Screen->BitMap.  In the future,
	bitmaps will need to grow.  The embedded instance of a bitmap
	in the screen will no longer be large enough to hold the whole
	description of the bitmap.

	YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED to use Screen->RastPort.BitMap in place of
	&Screen->BitMap whenever and whereever possible.

    NAME
	OpenWindow -- Open an Intuition window.

    SYNOPSIS
   	Window = OpenWindow( NewWindow )
	D0                   A0

	struct Window *OpenWindow( struct NewWindow * );

    FUNCTION
	Opens an Intuition window of the given dimensions and position,
	with the properties specified in the NewWindow structure.
	Allocates everything you need to get going.

	New for V36: there is an extensive discussion of public Screens
	and visitor windows at the end of this section.  Also,
	you can provide extensions to the NewWindow parameters using
	and array of TagItem structures.  See the discussion below,
	and the documentation for the function OpenScreenTagList().

	Before you call OpenWindow(), you must initialize an instance of
	a NewWindow structure.  NewWindow is a structure that contains
	all of the arguments needed to open a window.  The NewWindow
	structure may be discarded immediately after it is used to open 
	the window.
	
	If Type == CUSTOMSCREEN, you must have opened your own screen
	already via a call to OpenScreen().  Then Intuition uses your screen
	argument for the pertinent information needed to get your window
	going.  On the other hand, if type == one of the Intuition's standard
	screens, your screen argument is ignored.  Instead, 
	Intuition will check to see whether or not that screen
	already exists:  if it doesn't, it will be opened first before
	Intuition opens your window in the standard screen.

	New for V36: If you specify Type == WBENCHSCREEN, then your
	window will appear on the Workbench screen, unless the global
	public screen mode SHANGHAI is set, in which case your window
	will be "hijacked" to the default public screen.  See also
	SetPubScreenModes().
	
	New for V36: If the WFLG_NW_EXTENDED flag is set, it means that the
	field 'ExtNewWindow->Extension' points to an array of TagItems, as
	defined in intuition/tagitem.h.  This provides an extensible means
	of providing extra parameters to OpenWindow.  For compatibility
	reasons, we could not add the 'Extension' field to the NewWindow
	structure, so we have define a new structure ExtNewWindow, which
	is identical to NewWindow with the addition of the Extension field.

	We recommend that rather than using ExtNewWindow.Extension, you
	use the new Intuition function OpenWindowTagList() and its
	varargs equivalent OpenWindowTags().  We document the window
	attribute tag ID's (ti_Tag values) here, rather than in 
	OpenWindowTagList(), so that you can find all the parameters
	for a new window defined in one place.
	
	If the WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP flag is set, the bitmap variable must point
	to your own bitmap.
	
	The DetailPen and the BlockPen are used for system rendering; for
	instance, the title bar is first filled using the BlockPen, and then
	the gadgets and text are rendered using DetailPen.  You can either
	choose to supply special pens for your window, or, by setting either
	of these arguments to -1, the screen's pens will be used instead.

	Note for V36: The DetailPen and BlockPen no longer determine
	what colors will be used for window borders, if your window
	opens on a "full-blown new look screen."

    INPUTS
	NewWindow = pointer to an instance of a NewWindow structure.  That
               structure is initialized with the following data:
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Left = the initial x-position for your window
	Top = the initial y-position for your window
	Width = the initial width of this window
	Height = the initial height of this window

	DetailPen = pen number (or -1) for the rendering of window details
         (like gadgets or text in title bar)
	BlockPen = pen number (or -1) for window block fills (like title bar)
	[For V36: Title bar colors are determined otherwise.]

	Flags = specifiers for your requirements of this window, including:
	     which system gadgets you want attached to your window:

	    - WFLG_DRAGBAR allows this window to be dragged
	    - WFLG_DEPTHGADGET lets the user depth-arrange this window
	    - WFLG_CLOSEGADGET attaches the standard close gadget
	    - WFLG_SIZEGADGET allows this window to be sized. 
	    
	    If you ask for the WFLG_SIZEGADGET gadget, you must specify one or
	    both of the flags WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT and WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM below; if
	    you don't, the default is WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT.  See the following items
	    WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT and WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM for more details.

	    - WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT is a special system gadget flag that
	      you set to specify whether or not you want the
	      RIGHT border adjusted to account for the physical size 
	      of the sizing gadget.  The sizing gadget must, after
	      all, take up room in either the right or bottom border
	      (or both, if you like) of the window.  Setting either
	      this or the WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM flag selects which edge 
	      will take up the slack.  This will be particularly
	      useful to applications that want to use the extra space
	      for other gadgets (like a proportional gadget and two
	      Booleans done up to look like scroll bars) or, for
	      for instance, applications that want every possible
	      horizontal bit and are willing to lose lines vertically.
	      NOTE:  if you select WFLG_SIZEGADGET, you must select 
	      either WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT or WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM or both.  If
	      you select neither, the default is WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT.
	    - WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM is a special system gadget flag that
	      you set to specify whether or not you want the
	      BOTTOM border adjusted to account for the physical size 
	      of the sizing gadget.  For details, refer to
	      WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT above.

	    - WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO for easy but expensive output

	    what type of window layer you want, either:
	    - WFLG_SIMPLE_REFRESH
	    - WFLG_SMART_REFRESH
	    - WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP

	    - WFLG_BACKDROP for whether or not you want this window to be one
	      of Intuition's special backdrop windows.  See WFLG_BORDERLESS
	      as well.

	    - WFLG_REPORTMOUSE for whether or not you want to "listen" to
	      mouse movement events whenever your window is the active
	      one.  After you've opened your window, if you want to change
	      you can later change the status of this via a call to
	      ReportMouse().  Whether or not your window is listening to
	      mouse is affected by gadgets too, since they can cause you
	      to start getting reports too if you like.  The mouse move
	      reports (either InputEvents or messages on the IDCMP) that
	      you get will have the x/y coordinates of the current mouse
	      position, relative to the upper-left corner of your window
	      (WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO notwithstanding).  This flag can work in
	      conjunction with the IDCMP Flag called IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE, which
	      allows you to listen via the IDCMP.

	    - WFLG_BORDERLESS should be set if you want a window with no
	      border padding.  Your window may have the border variables
	      set anyway, depending on what gadgetry you've requested for
	      the window, but you won't get the standard border lines and
	      spacing that comes with typical windows.  

	      This is a good way to take over the entire screen, since you
	      can have a window cover the entire width of the screen using
	      this flag.  This will work particularly well in conjunction
	      with the WFLG_BACKDROP flag (see above), since it allows you
	      to open a window that fills the ENTIRE screen.  NOTE:  this is
	      not a flag that you want to set casually, since it may cause
	      visual confusion on the screen.  The window borders are the
	      only dependable visual division between various windows and
	      the background screen.  Taking away that border takes away
	      that visual cue, so make sure that your design doesn't need
	      it at all before you proceed.

	    - WFLG_ACTIVATE is the flag you set if you want this window to
	      automatically become the active window.  The active
	      window is the one that receives input from the keyboard and
	      mouse.  It's usually a good idea to to have the window you
	      open when your application first starts up be an ACTIVATED
	      one, but all others opened later not be ACTIVATED (if the
	      user is off doing something with another screen, for
	      instance, your new window will change where the input is
	      going, which would have the effect of yanking the input rug
	      from under the user).  Please use this flag thoughtfully and
	      carefully.

	      Some notes: First, your window may or may not be active
	      by the time this function returns.  Use the IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW
	      IDCMP message to know when your window has become active.
	      Also, be very careful not to mistakenly specify the
	      obsolete flag names WINDOWACTIVE or ACTIVEWINDOW.  These are
	      used in other contexts, and their values unintentionally added
	      to your flags can cause most unfortunate results.  To avoid
	      confusion, they are now know as WFLG_WINDOWACTIVE and
	      IDCMP_ACTIVEWINDOW.

	    - WFLG_RMBTRAP, when set, causes the right mouse button events 
	      to be trapped and broadcast as events.  You can receive 
	      these events through either the IDCMP or the console.

	    - WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH indicates that you do not wish to
	      be responsible for calling BeginRefresh() and EndRefresh()
	      when your window has exposed regions (i.e., when the
	      IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message would be generated).  See also
	      the descriptions of these two functions.

	    - WFLG_NW_EXTENDED (V36) indicates that NewWindow in fact points
	      to an ExtNewWindow structure, and that the 'Extension'
	      field points to an array of TagItem structures, with
	      meaning described below.

	    - WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS (V39) Requests new-look menu treatment.
	      Menu colors are derived from the screen DrawInfo BARDETAILPEN,
	      BARBLOCKPEN, and BARTRIMPEN, instead of window detail and
	      block pens.  Also requests that a suitably scaled and colored
	      Amiga-key symbol and checkmark symbol be used in the menus.
	      Applications using WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS need to use the new screen
	      DrawInfo pens to color their MenuItem and SubItem imagery.
	      If your application uses GadTools, the {GTMN_NewLookMenus,TRUE}
	      tag-item should be passed to the menu layout calls.

	      (NB: For the menus to actually appear with improved colors,
	      the screen's opener must supply suitable values for the
	      new menu pens in the DrawInfo.  If this is not the case,
	      then an application requesting NewLookMenus will get the
	      scaled Amiga-key and checkmark but in V37-compatible colors.
	      Note that the screen's DrawInfo will always contain valid
	      values for the new pens;  they just may correspond to the
	      "old look").

	IDCMPFlags = IDCMP is the acronym for Intuition Direct Communications
	    Message Port.  (It's Intuition's sole acronym.) If any of the
	    IDCMP Flags is selected, Intuition will create a pair of
	    message ports and use them for direct communications with the
	    task opening this window (as compared with broadcasting
	    information via the Console device).  See the "Input and
	    Output Methods" chapter of the Intuition Reference Manual for
	    complete details.

	    You request an IDCMP by setting any of these flags.  Except
	    for the special VERIFY flags, every other flag you set tells
	    Intuition that if a given event occurs which your program
	    wants to know about, it is to broadcast the details of that
	    event through the IDCMP rather than via the Console device.
	    This allows a program to interface with Intuition directly,
	    rather than going through the Console device.

	    Many programs have elected to use IDCMP communication
	    exclusively, and not to associate a console with their
	    windows at all.  Some operations, such as IDCMP_MENUVERIFY,
	    can ONLY be achieved using IDCMP.

           The IDCMP flags you can set are described in the
	    ModifyIDCMP() autodoc.

	Gadgets = the pointer to the first of a linked list of the your own 
	      Gadgets which you want attached to this Window.  Can be NULL
	      if you have no Gadgets of your own

       CheckMark = a pointer to an instance of the struct Image where can
	      be found the imagery you want used when any of your
	      menu items is to be checkmarked.  If you don't want to
	      supply your own imagery and you want to just use 
	      Intuition's own checkmark, set this argument to NULL

       Text = a null-terminated line of text to appear on the title bar of
	      your window (may be null if you want no text)

       Type = the screen type for this window.  If this equal CUSTOMSCREEN,
	      you must have already opened a CUSTOMSCREEN (see text above).
	      Types available include:
		  - WBENCHSCREEN
		  - CUSTOMSCREEN
		  - PUBLICSCREEN (new for V36, see text below)

       Screen = if your type is one of Intuition's standard screens, then
	      this argument is ignored.  However, if Type == CUSTOMSCREEN,
	      this must point to the structure of your own screen

       BitMap = if you have specified WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP as the type of
	       refreshing you want for this window, then this value points to a
	       instance of the struct bitmap.  However, if the refresh type
	       is NOT WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP, this pointer is ignored.

       MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth, MaxHeight = the size limits for this 
	      window.  These must be reasonable values, which is to say that
	      the minimums cannot be greater than the current size, nor can
	      the maximums be smaller than the current size.  If they are,
	      they're ignored.  Any one of these can be initialized to zero,
	      which means that that limit will be set to the current
	      dimension of that axis.  The limits can be changed after the
	      Window is opened by calling the WindowLimits() routine.

	      NOTE: ORIGINALLY, we stated that:

	      "If you haven't requested the WFLG_SIZEGADGET option, these
	      variables are ignored so you don't have to initialize them."

	      It is now clear that a variety of programs take it upon
	      themselves to call SizeWindow() (or ChangeWindowBox()) without
	      your program's consent or consulting your WFLG_SIZEGADGE
	      option.  To protect yourself against the results, we strongly
	      urge that if you supply suitable values for these fields even
	      if you do not specify WFLG_SIZEGADGET.

	      The maximums may be LARGER than the current size, or even
	      larger than the current screen.  The maximums should be set to
	      the highest value your application can handle.  This allows
	      users with larger display devices to take full advantage of
	      your software.  If there is no good reason to limit the size,
	      then don't.  -1 or ~0 indicates that the maximum size is only
	      limited by the size of the window's screen.

	      See also the docs on the function WindowLimits() for more
	      information.

       Extension (New for V36) = a pointer to an array (or chain of arrays)
	    of TagItems to specify additional parameters to OpenWindow().
	    TagItems in general are described in utility/tagitem.h,
	    and the OpenWindow tags are defined in intuition/intuition.h
	    and described here.  For items pertaining to Public Screens
	    and visitor windows, please see below.

	Here are the TagItem.ti_Tag values that are defined for OpenWindow
	(and OpenWindowTagList()).

	Certain tags simply override equivalent values in NewWindow,
	and allow you to open a window using OpenWindowTagList() without
	having a NewWindow structure at all.  In each case, cast
	the corresponding data to ULONG and put it in ti_Data.

	The compatible tag items include:

	WA_Left
	WA_Top
	WA_Width
	WA_Height
	WA_DetailPen	- NOTE: only overrides NewWindow.DetailPen of -1!
	WA_BlockPen	- NOTE: only overrides NewWindow.BlockPen of -1!
	WA_IDCMP
	WA_Flags	- initial values for Flags before looking at other
			  Boolean component Tag values
	WA_Gadgets
	WA_Title
	WA_CustomScreen	- also implies CUSTOMSCREEN property
	WA_SuperBitMap	- also implies WFLG_SUPER_BITMAP refresh mode.
	WA_MinWidth
	WA_MinHeight
	WA_MaxWidth
	WA_MaxHeight

	These Boolean tag items are alternatives to the NewWindow.Flags
	Boolean attributes with similar names.

	WA_SizeGadget		- equivalent to WFLG_SIZEGADGET
	WA_DragBar		- equivalent to WFLG_DRAGBAR
	WA_DepthGadget		- equivalent to WFLG_DEPTHGADGET
	WA_CloseGadget		- equivalent to WFLG_CLOSEGADGET
	WA_Backdrop		- equivalent to WFLG_BACKDROP
	WA_ReportMouse		- equivalent to WFLG_REPORTMOUSE
	WA_NoCareRefresh	- equivalent to WFLG_NOCAREREFRESH
	WA_Borderless		- equivalent to WFLG_BORDERLESS
	WA_Activate		- equivalent to WFLG_ACTIVATE
	WA_RMBTrap		- equivalent to WFLG_RMBTRAP
	WA_WBenchWindow		- equivalent to WFLG_WBENCHWINDOW
				  (system PRIVATE)
	WA_SimpleRefresh 	- only specify if TRUE
	WA_SmartRefresh 	- only specify if TRUE
	WA_SizeBRight		- equivalent to WFLG_SIZEBRIGHT
	WA_SizeBBottom		- equivalent to WFLG_SIZEBBOTTOM
	WA_GimmeZeroZero 	- equivalent to WFLG_GIMMEZEROZERO
	WA_NewLookMenus		- equivalent to WFLG_NEWLOOKMENUS

	The following tag items specify new attributes of a window.

	WA_ScreenTitle - You can specify the screen title associated
	    with your window this way, and avoid a call to SetWindowTitles()
	    when your window opens.

	WA_AutoAdjust - a Boolean attribute which says that it's OK
	    to move or even shrink the dimensions of this window
	    to fit it on the screen, within the dimension
	    limits specified by MinWidth and MinHeight.
	    Someday, this processing might be sensitive to the
	    currently visible portion of the screen the window
	    will be opening on, so don't draw too many conclusions
	    about the auto-adjust algorithms.
	    (Normally, this attribute defaults to FALSE.  However,
	    if you call OpenWindowTags() or OpenWindowTagList()
	    with a NULL NewWindow pointer, this attribute defaults
	    to TRUE).

	WA_InnerWidth
	WA_InnerHeight - You can specify the dimensions of the interior
	    region of your window, independent of what the border
	    thicknesses will be.  You probably want to specify
	    WA_AutoAdjust to allow Intuition to move your window
	    or even shrink it so that it is completely on screen.

	    Note: using these tags puts some reasonable restrictions
	    on the gadgets you can specify as "border" gadgets when
	    you open your window.  Since border gadgets determine
	    the border dimensions and hence the overall dimensions of
	    your window, those dimensions cannot be used calculating
	    the position or dimensions of border gadgets.

	    Here's the complete list of restrictions:
	    - GACT_LEFTBORDER gadgets cannot be GFLG_RELWIDTH if
	      WA_InnerWidth is used.
	    - GACT_RIGHTBORDER gadgets MUST be GFLG_RELRIGHT if
	      WA_InnerWidth is used.
	    - GACT_TOPBORDER gadgets cannot be GFLG_RELHEIGHT if
	      WA_InnerHeight is used.
	    - GACT_BOTTOMBORDER gadgets MUST be GFLG_RELBOTTOM if
	      WA_InnerHeight is used.

	WA_PubScreenName - This tag item declares that you want your window
	    to open as a visitor window on the public screen whose name
	    is pointed to by (UBYTE *) ti_Data.

	WA_PubScreen - Open as a visitor window on the public screen
	    whose address if provided as (struct Screen *) ti_Data.
	    To ensure that this screen remains open long enough, you
	    must either:
		1) Be the screen's owner
		2) have another window already open on the screen
		3) use LockPubScreen()
	    Using exec.library/Forbid() is not sufficient.

	    You can provide ti_Data to be NULL (zero), without any
	    of the above precautions, to specify the default public screen.

	WA_PubScreenFallBack - This Boolean attribute specifies that a
	    visitor window should "fall back" to opening on the default
	    public screen if the explicitly specify public screen is not
	    available.

	WA_WindowName - this visionary specification of a window
	    rendezvous name string is not yet implemented.

	WA_Colors - this equally great idea about associating a palette
	    specification with the active window may not ever be implemented.

	WA_Zoom - ti_Data points to an array of four WORD's to be used
	    as the initial Left/Top/Width/Height of the "alternate
	    Zoom position and dimensions."  The presence of this tag
	    item implies that you want a Zoom gadget, even though you
	    might not have a sizing gadget.
	    New for V39: if the initial zoom-box left and top are
	    both set to ~0, then Intuition will give your window
	    "size-only" zooming, meaning that zooming the window
	    will not affect the left/top unless the window needs
	    to be moved on-screen.

	WA_MouseQueue - This tag specifies a limit for the number
	    of outstanding IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE IntuiMessages that Intuition
	    will send to your window.  You can change the value of this
	    limit after the window is open using SetMouseQueue().

	WA_RptQueue - This tag specifies a limit for the number of
	    outstanding repeated-IDCMP_RAWKEY, repeated-IDCMP_VANILLAKEY,
	    and repeated-IDCMP_IDCMPUPDATE IntuiMessages that Intuition will
	    send to your window.  Currently, there is no function to adjust
	    the repeat-key queue.

	WA_BackFill - ti_Data is a pointer to a Hook structure that
	    the Layers library will call when your window needs
	    "backfilling."  See layers.library/InstallLayerHook().

 	WA_MenuHelp - ti_Data is a boolean.  If true, enables the MenuHelp
	    feature for this window.  See IDCMP_MENUHELP above.  (V37)

	WA_NotifyDepth - ti_Data is a boolean.  Set to true if you
	    would also like IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW events sent to your window
	    when it is depth-arranged.  Normally, such events are only
	    sent for movement or resizing of the window.
	    IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW events originating from
	    depth-arrangement have a Code equal to CWCODE_DEPTH, as
	    opposed to CWCODE_MOVESIZE.  (V39)

	WA_Checkmark - (ti_Data is struct Image *) Image to use as a
	    checkmark in menus.  Prior to V39, or if WA_NewLookMenus
	    is not specified, the default will be the traditional
	    checkmark in the original colors.  Under V39 and higher,
	    if you have requested WA_NewLookMenus then the default will
	    be an appropriately colored checkmark scaled to the screen's
	    font.  Alternately, you can provide a custom one, which you
	    candesign yourself or get from sysiclass (use this if
	    your menu-font is different from the screen's font).

	WA_AmigaKey - (ti_Data is struct Image *) Image to use as
	    the Amiga-key symbol in menus.  If WA_NewLookMenus is not
	    specified, the default will be the traditional Amiga-key
	    symbol in the original colors.  If you've requested
	    WA_NewLookMenus, then the default will be an appropriately
	    colored Amiga-key scaled to the screen's font.
	    Alternately, you can provide a custom one, which you can
	    design yourself or get from sysiclass (use this if your
	    menu-font is different from the screen's font).  (V39)

	WA_Pointer - (APTR) The pointer you wish to associate with
	    your window.  If NULL, you are requesting the Preferences
	    default pointer.  Custom pointers should be allocated by
	    performing a NewObject() on "pointerclass".  (See
	    <intuition/pointerclass.h>).  Defaults to NULL.  This tag is
	    also recognized by SetWindowPointerA().  (V39)

	WA_BusyPointer (BOOL) - Set to TRUE to request the Preferences
	    busy-pointer.  If FALSE, your pointer will be as requested
	    by WA_Pointer.  Defaults to FALSE.  This tag is also
	    recognized by SetWindowPointerA().  (V39)

	WA_PointerDelay - (BOOL) Set to TRUE to defer changing your
	    pointer for a brief instant.  This is typically used along
	    with setting the busy pointer, especially when the
	    application knows it may be busy for a very short while.  If
	    the application clears the pointer or sets another pointer
	    before the delay expires, the pending pointer change is
	    cancelled.  This reduces short flashes of the busy pointer.
	    This tag is also recognized by SetWindowPointerA().  (V39)

	WA_HelpGroup - (ULONG) Normally, only the active window can
	    receive IDCMP_GADGETHELP messages.  However, an application
	    with multiple windows will want all its windows to be able
	    to receive help when any of them are active.  First obtain a
	    unique help ID with utility.library/GetUniqueID(), then
	    pass it as ti_Data of this tag to all your windows.  See
	    HelpControl().  (V39)

	WA_HelpGroupWindow - (struct Window *) Instead of using
	    WA_HelpGroup, you can pass a pointer to another window
	    whose HelpGroup you wish this window to belong to.  (V39)

	WA_TabletMessages - (BOOL) Set to TRUE to request extended
	    IntuiMessages for your window.  If a tablet driver is
	    generating IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET input events, you will be
	    able to receive extended tablet information with most
	    IntuiMessages.  See the eim_TabletData field of the
	    ExtIntuiMessage structure.  Defaults to FALSE.  (V39)

   NOTES
	Regarding Public Screens, you can specify a window to be a 
	"visitor window" on a public screen in one of several ways.
	In each case, you must be sure not to specify a NewWindow
	type of CUSTOMSCREEN.  You should use the value PUBLICSCREEN.

	There are actually several ways you can specify which screen
	you want a visitor window to be opened on:

	    1) Specify the name of the public screen WA_PubScreenName,
	    or a NULL pointer, in ti_Data.  The name might have been
	    provided by the user.  A NULL pointer means to use the
	    default public screen.

	    If the named screen cannot be found, the default public screen
	    will be used if the Boolean attribute WA_PubScreenFallBack
	    is TRUE.

	    2) Specify a pointer to a public screen using the
	    WA_PubScreen tag item.  The WA_PubScreenFallBack
	    attribute has no effect.  You can specify the default
	    public screen by providing a NULL pointer.

	    You can also specify the pointer by setting NewWindow.Type
	    to PUBLICSCREEN, and specifying the public screen pointer
	    in NewWindow.Screen.  The WA_PubScreen tag item has precedent
	    over this technique.

	    Unless NULL, the screen pointer provided MUST be a valid
	    public screen.  You may ensure this several ways:

	    - Be the owner of the screen.
	    - Have a window already open on the screen.
	    - Use LockPubScreen() to prevent the screen from closing.
	    - specifying the WFLG_VISITOR bit in NewWindow.Flags is not
	      supported.

	    It is anticipated that the last will be the most common method
	    of opening public screens because you often want to examine
	    properties of the screen your window will be using in order
	    to compensate for differences in dimension, depth, and font.

	    The standard sequence for this method is as follows:
	    LockPubScreen()	- obtain a pointer and a promise
	    layout window	- adapt your window to the screen you will use
	    OpenWindow()	- using the pointer you specify
	    UnlockPubScreen()	- once your window is open, you can let go
				  of the lock on the public screen
	    ... normal window even processing ...
	    CloseWindow().

	Regarding "service" windows, such as those opened for a system
	requester or file requester associated with a given "client"window.
	These windows should NOT be "visitor" windows.  Open them
	using NewWindow.Type = CUSTOMSCREEN and NewWindow.Screen
	equal to the screen of the client window (window->WScreen).
	You can also use WA_CustomScreen, which has precedence.

	This ensures that the requester service window will be allowed to
	open on the same screen as the client window, even if that
	screen is not a public screen, or has private status.

	This has an implication for service/client protocol: when you
	pass a window pointer to any system requester routine or
	to a routine which creates some other other service window,
	you MUST keep your window open until the client window
	is closed.

	If a requester service will allow a NULL client window, this
	should indicate to open the service window on the default public
	screen (probably Workbench).  The correct way to get a pointer 
	to this screen is to call LockPubScreen( NULL ).  In this
	case, you want to open as a visitor window, which means you
	should use either PUBLICSCREEN or WA_PubScreen, described above.
	You should call UnlockPubScreen() after your visitor window is open.

	As of V36, gadgets in the right and bottom border
	(specified with GACT_RIGHTBORDER and GACT_BOTTOMBORDER) only
	contribute to the dimensions of the borders if they are also
	GFLG_RELRIGHT and GFLG_RELBOTTOM, respectively.

    RESULT
	If all is well, returns the pointer to your new Window
	If anything goes wrong, returns NULL

    BUGS
	When you open a window, Intuition will set the font of
	the window's RastPort to the font of the window's screen.
	This does not work right for GimmeZeroZero windows: the
	BorderRPort RastPort has the font set correctly, but
	Window.RPort is set up with the system default font.
	For compatibility reasons, we won't be fixing this problem.

	Also, there is a compatibility trick going on with the
	default font of your window's RastPort if the screen's
	font is "fancy."  See the SA_SysFont attribute described
	under OpenScreen().

	Unless you arrange otherwise, each window you open will allocate
	a signal for your task from the 16 "user signals."
	If no signal is available, your window will not be able
	to be opened.  In early V36 versions and before, Intuition didn't
	check this condition, but just left you with an unusable port.

   NAME	
	OpenWindowTagList -- OpenWindow() with TagItem extension. (V36)
	OpenWindowTags -- Varargs stub for OpenWindowTagList (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	Window = OpenWindowTagList( NewWindow, TagItems )
	D0	  		    A0         A1

	struct Window *OpenWindowTagList( struct NewWindow *,
		struct TagItem * );

	Window = OpenWindowTags( NewWindow, Tag1, ... )

	struct Window *OpenWindowTags( struct NewWindow *, ULONG, ... );

   FUNCTION
	A variation of OpenWindow() that allow direct specification of
	a TagItem array of extension data.  Recommended over using the
	ExtNewWindow.Extension field.

	If you omit the NewWindow (pass NULL), a set of defaults
	are used, and overridden by the tag items.  Even without
	any tag items at all, a reasonable window opens on the Workbench
	or default public screen.

	See OpenWindow() for all the details.

   INPUTS
 	NewWindow - (optional) pointer to a NewWindow structure.
	TagItems - (optional) pointer to TagItem array, with tag
		values as described under the description for
		OpenWindow().

   RESULT
 	Window - newly created window, per your specifications.

   EXAMPLE
	See OpenScreenTagList() for an example of how to create
	a "varargs" version of this function for convenient C
	language programming.

	OpenWorkBench -- Open the Workbench screen.

    SYNOPSIS 
	WBScreen = OpenWorkBench()
	D0

	ULONG OpenWorkBench( VOID );
 
    FUNCTION 
	This routine attempts to reopen the Workbench.  The actions taken are: 
	    - general good stuff and nice things, and then return a non-null
	      pointer to the Workbench screen.
	    - find that something has gone wrong, and return NULL
 
	The return value, if not NULL, is indeed the address of the Workbench
	screen, although you should not use it as such.  This is because the
	Workbench may be closed by other programs, which can invalidate
	the address at any time.  We suggest that you regard the return
	value as a ULONG indication that the routine has succeeded, if
	you pay any attention to it at all.
 
    INPUTS 
	None 
 
    RESULT 
	non-zero if Workbench screen opened successfully, or was already
		opened 
	zero if anything went wrong and the Workbench screen isn't out there

   SYNOPSIS
	DoesContain = PointInImage( Point, Image )
	D0	  		    D0     A0
	
	BOOL PointInImage( struct Point, struct Image * );

   FUNCTION
	Tests whether a point is properly contained in an image.
	The intention of this is to provide custom gadgets a means
	to delegate "image mask" processing to the Image, where
	it belongs (superseding things like BOOLMASK).  After all,
	a rounded rect image with a drop shadow knows more about
	what points are inside it than anybody else should.

	For traditional Intuition Images, this routine checks if
	the point is in the Image box (LeftEdge/RightEdge/Width/Height).

   INPUTS
 	Point	- Two words, X/Y packed into a LONG, with high word
		containing 'X'.  This is what you get if you pass
		a Point structure (not a pointer!) using common
		C language parameter conventions.
	Image - a pointer to a standard or custom Image data object.
	    NOTE: If 'Image' is NULL, this function returns TRUE.

   RESULT
 	DoesContain - Boolean result of the test.

	Only applies to the first image, does not follow NextImage
	linked list.  This might be preferred.

    SYNOPSIS
	PrintIText( RastPort, IText, LeftOffset, TopOffset )
		    A0        A1     D0          D1

	VOID PrintIText( struct RastPort *, struct IntuiText *, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	Prints the IntuiText into the specified RastPort.  Sets up the RastPort
	as specified by the IntuiText values, then prints the text into the
	RastPort at the IntuiText x/y coordinates offset by the left/top 
	arguments.  Note, though, that the IntuiText structure itself
	may contain further text position coordinates: those coordinates
	and the Left/TopOffsets are added to obtain the true position of
	the text to be rendered.

	This routine does window layer clipping as appropriate -- if you 
	print text outside of your window, your characters will be 
	clipped at the window's edge, providing you pass your window's
	(layered) RastPort.

	If the NextText field of the IntuiText argument is non-NULL, 
	the next IntuiText is rendered as well, and so on until some
	NextText field is NULL.
	
	IntuiText with the ITextFont field NULL are displayed in the
	font of the RastPort.  If the RastPort font is also NULL, the
	system default font, as set via the Preferences tool, will be used.

    INPUTS
	RastPort = the RastPort destination of the text
	IText = pointer to an instance of the structure IntuiText
	LeftOffset = left offset of the IntuiText into the RastPort

	UWORD PubScreenStatus( struct Screen *, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	Changes status flags for a given public screen.  The only
	flag bit currently defined is PSNF_PRIVATE.  Thus,
	PubScreenStatus( screen, PSNF_PRIVATE ) makes a screen
	private, while PubScreenStatus( screen, 0 ) makes it public.

	Do not apply this function to a screen if your program
	isn't the screen's "owner", in particular, don't call
	this function for the Workbench screen.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to public screen
	StatusFlags = Any of the PSNF_ flags (only PSNF_PRIVATE is
	    currently defined).

    RESULT
	Returns 0 in the lowest order bit of the return value

    SYNOPSIS
	success = QueryOverscan( DisplayID, Rect, OScanType )
	D0                       A0         A1    D0

	LONG QueryOverscan( ULONG, struct Rectangle *, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	This function fills in a rectangle with one of the system
	overscan dimensions, scaled appropriately for the mode of
	the DisplayID it is passed.

	There are three types of system overscan values:
	OSCAN_TEXT: completely visible, by user preference.  Used
	  for Workbench screen and screen dimensions STDSCREENWIDTH
	  and STDSCREENHEIGHT.  Left/Top is always 0,0.
	OSCAN_STANDARD: just beyond visible bounds of monitor, by
	  user preference.  Left/Top may be negative.
	OSCAN_MAX: The largest region we can display, AND display
	  any smaller region (see note below).
	OSCAN_VIDEO: The absolute largest region that the graphics.library
	  can display.  This region must be used as-is.
	

    INPUTS
	DisplayID -- A 32-bit identifier for a display mode, as defined
	  in the <graphics/modeid.h> include file (V39 and up) or in
	  <graphics/displayinfo.h> (V37/V38).

	  NOTE: If you only intend to use one of the four standard
	  overscan dimensions as is, and open your screen to exactly
	  the DisplayClip dimensions, you can specify one of
	  the OSCAN_ values using the SA_Overscan tag to the
	  OpenScreenTagList() function and omit all of SA_Left, SA_Top,
	  SA_Width, and SA_Height.  This also requires that you do
	  not supply a NewScreen structure, since it always contains
	  left/top/width/height information.

	  If you wish to supply a NewScreen structure, then you are
	  supplying left/top/width/height information.  This information 
	  can be taken from the rectangle resulting from this function:
		NewScreen.LeftEdge = Rect.MinX;
		NewScreen.TopEdge = Rect.MinY;
		NewScreen.Width = STDSCREENWIDTH;
			/* or ( Rect.MaxX - Rect.MinX + 1 ) */
		NewScreen.Height = STDSCREENHEIGHT;
			/* or ( Rect.MaxY - Rect.Miny + 1 ) */

	Rect -- pointer to a Rectangle structure which this function
	  will fill out with its return values.  Note that to convert
	  a rectangle to a screen "Height" you do (MaxY - MinY + 1), and
	  similarly for "Width."  The rectangle may be passed directly
	  to OpenScreen() as a DisplayClip region (SA_DClip).

    RESULT
	0 (FALSE) if the MonitorSpec your NewScreen requests
	does not exist.  Non-zero (TRUE) if it does.

intuition.library/RefreshGadgets             intuition.library/RefreshGadgets

    NAME
	RefreshGadgets -- Refresh (redraw) the gadget display.

    SYNOPSIS
	RefreshGadgets( Gadgets, Window, Requester )
		        A0       A1      A2

	VOID RefreshGadgets( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester * );

    FUNCTION
	Refreshes (redraws) all of the gadgets in the gadget list starting
	from the specified gadget.  

	The window parameter must point to the window which contains the
	gadget, or which contains the requester that contains the gadget
	The requester parameter must only be valid if the gadget has the
	GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, a requirement for all requester gadgets.

	The Pointer argument points to a Window structure.

	The two main reasons why you might want to use this routine are:  
	first, that you've modified the imagery of the gadgets in your 
	display and you want the new imagery to be displayed; secondly, 
	if you think that some graphic operation you just performed 
	trashed the gadgetry of your display, this routine will refresh 
	the imagery for you.  

	Note that to modify the imagery of a gadget, you must first remove
	that gadget from the window's gadget list, using RemoveGadget() (or
	RemoveGList()).  After changing the image, border, text (including
	text for a string gadget), the gadget is replaced in the gadget list
	(using AddGadget() or AddGList()).  Adding gadgets does not cause
	them to be displayed (refreshed), so this function, or RefreshGList()
	is typically called.

	A common technique is to set or reset the GFLG_SELECTED flag of a 
	Boolean gadget and then call RefreshGadgets() to see it displayed
	highlighted if and only if GFLG_SELECTED is set.  If you wish to do
	this and be completely proper, you must RemoveGadget(), change the
	GFLG_SELECTED flag, AddGadget(), and RefreshGadgets(), or the
	equivalent.

	The gadgets argument can be a copy of the FirstGadget variable in 
	the Window structure that you want refreshed:  
	the effect of this will be that all gadgets will be redrawn.  
	However, you can selectively refresh just some of the gadgets 
	by starting the refresh part-way into the list:  for instance, 
	redrawing your window non-GTYP_GZZGADGET gadgets only, which you've 
	conveniently grouped at the end of your gadget list.  

	Even more control is available using the RefreshGList() routine which
	enables you to refresh a single gadget, or number of your choice.

	NOTE:  It's never safe to tinker with the gadget list yourself.  Don't
	supply some gadget list that Intuition hasn't already processed in
	the usual way.

    INPUTS
	Gadgets = pointer to the first in the list of gadgets wanting
	    refreshment
	Window = pointer to the window containing the gadget or its requester
	Requester = pointer to a requester (ignored if gadget is not attached
	    to a requester).

	RefreshGList -- Refresh (redraw) a chosen number of gadgets.

    SYNOPSIS
	RefreshGList( Gadgets, Window, Requester, NumGad )
		      A0       A1      A2         D0

	VOID RefreshGList( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester *, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	Refreshes (redraws) gadgets in the gadget list starting
	from the specified gadget.  At most NumGad gadgets are redrawn.
	If NumGad is -1, all gadgets until a terminating NULL value
	in the NextGadget field is found will be refreshed, making this
	routine a superset of RefreshGadgets().

	The Requester parameter can point to a Requester structure.  If 
	the first gadget in the list has the GTYP_REQGADGET flag set, the 
	gadget list refers to gadgets in a requester and the pointer 
	must necessarily point to a window.  If these are not the gadgets 
	of a requester, the requester argument may be NULL.  

	Be sure to see the RefreshGadgets() function description, as this
	function is simply an extension of that.
   
    INPUTS
	Gadgets = pointer to the first in the list of gadgets wanting
	    refreshment
	Window = pointer to the window containing the gadget or its requester
	Requester = pointer to a requester (ignored if Gadget is not attached
	    to a Requester).
	NumGad  = maximum number of gadgets to be refreshed.  A value of -1
	  will cause all gadgets to be refreshed from gadget to the
	  end of the list.  A value of -2 will also do this, but if 'Gadgets'
	  points to a Requester Gadget (GTYP_REQGADGET) ALL gadgets in the
	  requester will be refreshed (this is a mode compatible with v1.1
	  RefreshGadgets().)

    FUNCTION
	This is the big one.

	This procedure remakes the entire View structure for the

	WARNING:  This routine can take many milliseconds to run, so
	do not use it lightly. 

	Calling MakeScreen() followed by RethinkDisplay() is typically
	a more efficient method for affecting changes to a single
	screen's ViewPort.

    INPUTS
	None

    RESULT
	Starting with V39, returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
	Probable cause of failure is failure of graphics.library/MakeVPort()

    NAME
	ReportMouse -- Tell Intuition whether to report mouse movement.

    SYNOPSIS
	ReportMouse( Boolean, Window )
		     D0       A0	<-note

	VOID ReportMouse( BOOL, struct Window * );

    SPECIAL NOTE
	Some compilers and link files switch the arguments to this function
	about in unpredictable ways.  We apologize for this confusion
	wrapped around an error enclosing a mistake.
	The call will take one of two forms:

		ReportMouse(Boolean, Window);
			-or-
		ReportMouse(Window, (ULONG)Boolean);

	The first form is the one that corresponds to the amiga.lib supplied
	by Commodore.  The linker libraries and "pragmas" of some compilers
	supply the alternate form.

	A key point to remember is that the form of the function in ROM
	has always been the same, so there has always been object code
	compatibility.  However some care should be taken when switching
	compilers or switching between stubs and pragmas.

	From assembler the interface has always been:
		Boolean in D0, Window in A0

	Also, it is still endorsed to simply set the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag bit
	in Window->Flags, or reset it, on your own.  Make the operation
	an atomic assembly instruction (OR.W #WFLG_REPORTMOUSE,wd_Flags+2(A0)
	where A0 contains your window pointer).  Most compilers will produce
	an atomic operation when faced with:
			Window->Flags |= WFLG_REPORTMOUSE;
			Window->Flags &=~WFLG_REPORTMOUSE;
	or else bracket the operation between Forbid()/Permit().

    FUNCTION
	Tells Intuition whether or not to broadcast mouse-movement events to
	your window when it's the active one.  The Boolean value specifies
	whether to start or stop broadcasting position information of
	mouse-movement.  If the window is the active one, mouse-movement reports
	start coming immediately afterwards.  This same routine will change
	the current state of the GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE function of a
	currently-selected gadget too.  

	Note that calling ReportMouse() when a gadget is selected will only
	temporarily change whether or not mouse	movements are reported while
	that gadget remains selected; the next time the gadget is selected, its
	GACT_FOLLOWMOUSE flag is examined anew.

	Note also that calling ReportMouse() when no gadget is currently
	selected will change the state of the window's WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag,
	but will have no effect on any gadget that may be subsequently
	selected. (This is all fixed in V36.)

	The ReportMouse() function is first performed when OpenWindow() 
	is first called; if the flag WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is included among
	the options, then all mouse-movement events are reported 
	to the opening task and will continue to be reported
	until ReportMouse() is called with a Boolean value of FALSE.
	If WFLG_REPORTMOUSE is not set, then no mouse-movement reports will
	be broadcast until ReportMouse() is called with a Boolean of TRUE.

	Note that the WFLG_REPORTMOUSE flag, as managed by this routine,
	determines IF mouse messages are to be broadcast.  Determining HOW
	they are to be broadcast is determined by the IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE
	IDCMPFlag.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure associated with this request
	Boolean = TRUE or FALSE value specifying whether to turn this
             function on or off

    RESULT
	None

    NAME
	Request -- Activate a requester.

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = Request( Requester, Window )
	D0		   A0         A1

	BOOL Request( struct Requester *, struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Links in and displays a requester into the specified window.  

	This routine ignores the window's IDCMP_REQVERIFY flag.

    INPUTS
	Requester = pointer to the requester to be displayed
	Window = pointer to the window into which this requester goes

	New for V36: the POINTREL flag now has meaning if the requester
	is not a DMR (Double-Menu Requester):
	If POINTREL is set this requester should be placed in the center
	of the window, offset by Requester.RelLeft and Requester.RelTop.
	If the requester doesn't fit in the window, its position will be
	adjusted to show the upper-left corner.

    RESULT
	If the requester is successfully opened, TRUE is returned.  Otherwise,
	if the requester could not be opened, FALSE is returned.

    BUGS
	It turns out that the return code of this function is not
	always correct under V34 and prior.  If your requester does
	not have an ENDGADGET, then you can examine window->FirstRequest
	to see if your requester successfully opened.  (A requester with
	an ENDGADGET can go away all by itself before you get the chance
	to look).  Under V36 and higher, the return code from this routine
	is fine.

	There is a maximum of 8 requesters that are supported in
	a window that can be changed in size, position, or depth.

    NAME
	ResetMenuStrip -- Re-attach a menu strip to a window. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = ResetMenuStrip( Window, Menu )
	D0		          A0      A1

	BOOL ResetMenuStrip( struct Window *, struct Menu * );

    FUNCTION
	This function is simply a "fast" version of SetMenuStrip() that
	doesn't perform the precalculations of menu page sizes that
	SetMenuStrip() does.

	You may call this function ONLY IF the menu strip and all items
	and sub-items have not changed since the menu strip was passed to
	SetMenuStrip(), with the following exceptions:

	- You may change the CHECKED flag to turn a checkmark on or off.
	- You may change the ITEMENABLED flag to enable/disable some
	  MenuItem or Menu structures.

	In all other ways, this function performs like SetMenuStrip().

	The new sequence of events you can use is:
	- OpenWindow()
	- SetMenuStrip()
	zero or more iterations of:
	    - ClearMenuStrip()
	    - change CHECKED or ITEMENABLED flags
	    - ResetMenuStrip()
	- ClearMenuStrip()
	- CloseWindow()

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure
	Menu = pointer to the first menu in the menu strip

    RESULT
	TRUE always.

intuition.library/RethinkDisplay             intuition.library/RethinkDisplay

    NAME
	RethinkDisplay -- Grand manipulation of the entire Intuition display.

    SYNOPSIS
	failure = RethinkDisplay()
	D0 (V39)

	LONG RethinkDisplay( VOID );
	/* Returns LONG in V39 and greater */

    FUNCTION
	This function performs the Intuition global display reconstruction.
	This includes rethinking about all of the  ViewPorts and their
	relationship to one another and reconstructing the entire display
	based on the results of this rethinking.

	Specifically, and omitting many internal details, the operation
	consists of this:

	    Determine which ViewPorts are invisible and set their VP_HIDE
	    ViewPort Mode flag. VP_HIDE flags are also set for screens that
	    may not be simultaneously displayed with the frontmost (V36).

	    If a change to a viewport height, or changing interlace or
	    monitor scan rates require, MakeVPort() is called for specific
	    screen viewports.  After this phase, the intermediate Copper lists
	    for each screen's viewport are correctly set up. 

	    MrgCop() and LoadView() are then called to get these Copper lists
	    in action, thus establishing the new state of the Intuition
	    display.
   
	You may perform a MakeScreen() on your Custom Screen before calling
	this routine.  The results will be incorporated in the new display, but
	changing the INTERLACE ViewPort mode for one screens must be reflected
	in the Intuition View, which is left to Intuition.

	WARNING:  This routine can take several milliseconds to run, so
	do not use it lightly. 

	New for V36: This routine is substantially changed to support
	new screen modes.  In particular, if screen rearrangement has
	caused a change in interlace mode or scan rate, this routine
	will remake the copper lists for each screen's viewport.

    INPUTS
	None

    RESULT
	Starting with V39, returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
	Probable cause of failure is failure of graphics.library/MakeVPort()
	or of graphics.library/MrgCop().
	Prior to V39, the return code is invalid.  Do not interpret it when
	running on pre-V39 systems!

    BUGS
	In V35 and earlier, an interlaced screen coming to the front
	may not trigger a complete remake as required when the global
	interlace state is changed.  In some cases, this can be compensated
	for by setting the viewport DHeight field to 0 for hidden screens.

    NAME
	ScreenDepth -- Depth arrange a screen with extra control. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	ScreenDepth( screen, flags, reserved )
	             A0      D0     A1

	VOID ScreenDepth( struct Screen *, ULONG, APTR );

    FUNCTION
	Brings the specified screen to the front or back, based on
	the supplied flags.  Also allows control of screen
	depth-arranging within screen families.

    INPUTS
	screen = a pointer to the screen to move
	flags = one of SDEPTH_TOFRONT or SDEPTH_TOBACK (bringing the
	    screen to front or back respectively).  If the screen
	    is an attached screen, then you may also specify
	    SDEPTH_INFAMILY to move the screen within the screen
	    family.  If the screen is an attached screen and
	    SDEPTH_INFAMILY is not specified, then the whole family
	    will move, which is also the behavior of the ScreenToFront()
	    and ScreenToBack() functions, as well as the user-interface
	    controls.
	reserved = must be NULL for now.

    RESULT
	None

    NOTES
	ONLY the application which owns the screen should use
	SDEPTH_INFAMILY.  It is incorrect style (and against the
	intentions of the screen opener) for programs such as
	commodities or mouse-helpers to move child screens around
	in their family.  (Note that this is a style-behavior
	requirement;  there is no technical requirement that the
	task calling this function need be the task which opened
	the screen).

    NAME
	ScreenPosition -- Move screens with greater control. (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	ScreenPosition( Screen, flags, x1, y1, x2, y2 )
	                A0      D0     D1  D2  D3  D4

	VOID ScreenPosition( struct Screen *, ULONG, LONG, LONG, LONG, LONG );

    FUNCTION
	Moves the screen to the specified position or by the specified
	increment, in screen pixel resolution coordinates.

	If the x1 and y1 variables you specify would move the screen in
	a way that violates any restrictions, the screen will be moved
	as far as possible.  You may examine the LeftEdge and TopEdge
	fields of the Screen structure after this function returns to
	see where the screen really ended up.

	Note that negative values for screen LeftEdge and TopEdge are
	valid for screens bigger than their display clip.

    INPUTS
	Screen = pointer to a Screen structure
	flags = Set to one of SPOS_RELATIVE, SPOS_ABSOLUTE, or
		SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE.   You may additionally set SPOS_FORCEDRAG
		if you need.  Use SPOS_RELATIVE (zero) for normal use
		(move screen a relative amount expressed by x1,y1).  Set
		the SPOS_ABSOLUTE flag if you wish x1 and y1 to be absolute
		coordinates to move the screen to.  Set SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE to
		position an oversized scrolling screen so that the rectangle
		described by (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) is on the visible part of
		the display. (A word-processor may wish to support
		autoscrolling as the user types.  In that case, it could
		call ScreenPosition() with the SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE flag and
		a rectangle that encompasses the cursor with some space
		around it.

		In addition to any one of the above choices, you can
		additionally set SPOS_FORCEDRAG if you wish to reposition
		a screen that was opened with the {SA_Draggable,FALSE}
		attribute.

	x1,y1 = Absolute position or change in position you wish to apply
		to the screen, when using SPOS_ABSOLUTE or SPOS_RELATIVE.
		When using SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE, these variables describe
		the upper-left corner of the rectangle you would like to
		ensure is on the visible part of a scrolling screen.
	x2,y2 = Ignored when using SPOS_ABSOLUTE or SPOS_RELATIVE.
		When using SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE, these variables describe
		the lower-right corner of the rectangle you would like to
		ensure is on the visible part of a scrolling screen.

		Note that these coordinates are in the same resolution
		as the screen (such as HIRES or INTERLACE)

    RESULT
	None

    NOTES
	ONLY the owner of the screen should use SPOS_FORCEDRAG.
	It is incorrect style (and against the intentions of the
	screen opener) for programs such as commodities or
	mouse-helpers to move non-draggable screens.

   NAME
        ScrollWindowRaster -- Intuition-friendly ScrollRasterBF() (V39)

   SYNOPSIS
        ScrollWindowRaster(win, dx, dy, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
                           A1   D0  D1  D2    D3    D4    D5

        void ScrollWindowRaster(struct Window *, WORD, WORD,
            WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD);

   FUNCTION
        Calls graphics.library/ScrollRasterBF(), which moves
        the bits in the raster by (dx,dy) towards (0,0)
        The space vacated is filled by calling EraseRect().
        NOTE: that vacated space is _not_ considered damage!
        The scroll operation is limited to the rectangle defined
        by (xmin,ymin)-(xmax,ymax). Bits outside will not be
        affected. If (xmax,ymax) is outside the rastport then use
        the lower right corner of the rastport.

        If a window is partly obscured, then it is possible for
        ScrollWindowRaster() to scroll some of the obscured
        area into view.  If the window is simple-refresh, then
        the formerly obscured area is damage, and the application
        needs to repair it.  If Intuition detects damage as a result
        of ScrollWindowRaster(), it will send an IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW
        event to the application's window.  This handling of damage
        is the principal reason ScrollWindowRaster() is preferred
        to ScrollRaster() and ScrollRasterBF().

   INPUTS
        win - pointer to a Window structure
        dx,dy are integers that may be postive, zero, or negative
        xmin,ymin - upper left of bounding rectangle
        xmax,ymax - lower right of bounding rectangle

   NOTES
        This call uses ScrollRasterBF(), which calls EraseRect()
        when clearing the newly exposed area. This allows use of
        a custom layer backfill hook.

        IMPORTANT:  boopsi gadgets should use ScrollRaster() or
        ScrollRasterBF() directly!  Never call ScrollWindowRaster()
        from inside a boopsi gadget's method handler.  Note that
        Intuition will detect and handle damage caused by such use
        of ScrollRaster() or ScrollRasterBF(), for gadgets with
        the GMORE_SCROLLRASTER property.

        VERY IMPORTANT:  if you have any gadgets in your simple-refresh
        window with the GMORE_SCROLLRASTER property, you must use
        ScrollWindowRaster() instead of ScrollRaster() or ScrollRasterBF().
        Handling of gadget scroll damage is incompatible with continued
        use of these graphics functions in an Intuition window.
        NB:  If you're using a gadget class whose source code you do
        not control, that class might be using GMORE_SCROLLRASTER or
        might start to in a future version.  For that reason, you
        should use ScrollWindowRaster() if you are using any such gadgets.

   BUGS
        In intuition.library V39 and V40 ScrollWindowRaster() must
        be considered unsafe in connection with gadget event handling
        and windows which do not have the WA_NoCareRefresh attribute set.
        A race condition may occur which will cause write accesses
        to unallocated memory and keep the IDCMP_REFRESHWINDOW message
        from getting delivered.

        The recommended workaround for this problem is to use
        ScrollWindowRaster() only in SMART_REFRESH windows which have
        the WA_NoCareRefresh attribute set. Of course, which such
        windows there will be no difference in functionality between
        ScrollWindowRaster() and ScrollRasterBF().

	BOOL SetDMRequest( struct Window *, struct Requester * );

    FUNCTION
	Attempts to set the DMRequest into the specified window.  
	The DMRequest is the special requester that you attach to 
	the double-click of the menu button which the user can then 
	bring up on demand.  This routine WILL NOT change the DMRequest
	if it's already set and is currently active (in use by the user).  
	After having called SetDMRequest(), if you want to change the 
	DMRequest, the correct way to start is by calling ClearDMRequest() 
	until it returns a value of TRUE; then you can call SetDMRequest() 
	with the new DMRequest.  

	If the POINTREL flag is set in the DMRequest, the DMR will open as
	close to the pointer as possible.  The RelLeft/Top fields are
	for fine-tuning the position.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window from which the DMRequest is to be set
	DMRequest = a pointer to a requester

    RESULT
	If the current DMRequest was not in use, sets the DMRequest
	    pointer into the window and returns TRUE.

	Do *NOT* use this in a commercial product until further notice.

    INPUTS
	Hook -- A pointer to a struct Hook which determines a function
	  in your code to be called every time the user types a key.
	  This is done before control is passed to the gadget custom
	  editing hook, so affects ALL string gadgets.

    RESULT
	Returns previous global edit hook structure.  You may need this
	hook if you wish to invoke the previous edit hook's behavior
	in addition to your own.

    NOTES
	There are a few key differences between a global edit hook and the
	more famililar per-gadget StringExtend->EditHook field.  In the
	case of the latter, the hook's creator supplies a WorkBuffer.
	Intuition's idea of the result of a keystroke is stored in
	the SGWork structure (which references the WorkBuffer).  The
	state of the gadget before Intuition's hook acted is available in
	the StringInfo->Buffer, ->BufferPos, and ->NumChars fields.

	In the case of a global editing hook, your hook _becomes_
	Intuition's hook, which affects all gadgets, most of which
	do not have a WorkBuffer.  This means that if you invoke
	Intuition's original hook (which you got as the result of this
	function), there isn't any easy way for you to "undo" that after
	the fact.  This means that if Intuition's behavior for certain
	keystrokes is incompatible with your hook's objectives, then
	you must avoid calling Intuition's hook for those keys.  One
	approach is to run through your hook's code first, acting on
	those keys you wish to recognize.  Then, call Intuition's
	hook for those keys you do not recognize, or for those keys
	whose default actions you wish to add to.

	Do not forget to set SGA_REDISPLAY when needed (see sghooks.h),
	and please be sure to give the SGWork->EditOp field a value
	which is as meaningful as possible.

	Currently, only SGH_KEY messages are sent to the global edit
	hook, though custom edit hooks do receive SGH_CLICK messages
	in addition.

	Finally, there is currently no arbitration between a global
	edit hook and a custom edit hook as to ownership of keystrokes.
	It would be fair to expect that a custom edit hook would be
	written to match the current Intuition edit hook.  If your
	global edit hook acts on (say) up and down arrow keystrokes,
	an undesirable result may occur if some string gadget's custom
	hook also acts on these keystrokes.  There is currently
	no easy way to resolve this issue.

    NAME
	SetGadgetAttrsA -- Specify attribute values for a boopsi gadget. (V36)
	SetGadgetAttrs -- Varargs stub for SetGadgetAttrsA(). (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	result = SetGadgetAttrsA( Gadget, Window, Requester, TagList )
	D0		          A0      A1      A2         A3

	ULONG SetGadgetAttrsA( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester *, struct TagItem * );

	result = SetGadgetAttrs( Gadget, Window, Requester, Tag1, ...)

	ULONG SetGadgetAttrs( struct Gadget *, struct Window *,
		struct Requester *, ULONG, ... );

    FUNCTION
	Same as SetAttrs(), but provides context information and
	arbitration for classes which implement custom Intuition gadgets.

	You should use this function for boopsi gadget objects which have
	already been added to a requester or a window, or for "models" which
	propagate information to gadget already added.

	Typically, the gadgets will refresh their visuals to reflect
	changes to visible attributes, such as the value of a slider,
	the text in a string-type gadget, the selected state of a button.

	You can use this as a replacement for SetAttrs(), too, if you
	specify NULL for the 'Window' and 'Requester' parameters.

    INPUTS
	Gadget = abstract pointer to a boopsi gadget
	Window = window gadget has been added to using AddGList() or AddGadget()
	Requester = for REQGADGETs, requester containing the gadget
	TagList = array of TagItem structures with attribute/value pairs.

    RESULT
	The object does whatever it wants with the attributes you provide,
	which might include updating its gadget visuals.

	The return value tends to be non-zero if the changes would require
	refreshing gadget imagery, if the object is a gadget.
	
    NOTES
	This function invokes the OM_SET method with a GadgetInfo
	derived from the 'Window' and 'Requester' pointers.

    BUGS
	Prior to V39, this function ran with inadequate locking against
	the calls that Intuition's input task makes to the gadgets.
	To run properly prior to V39, this function, input processing,
	and and the gadget's dispatcher must be mutually re-entrant.

intuition.library/SetMenuStrip                 intuition.library/SetMenuStrip

    NAME
	SetMenuStrip -- Attach a menu strip to a window.

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = SetMenuStrip( Window, Menu )
	D0		        A0      A1

	BOOL SetMenuStrip( struct Window *, struct Menu * );

    FUNCTION
	Attaches the menu strip to the window.  After calling this routine,
	if the user presses the menu button, this specified menu strip
	will be displayed and accessible by the user.

	Menus with zero menu items are not allowed.

	NOTE:  You should always design your menu strip changes to be a 
	two-way operation, where for every menu strip you add to your 
	window you should always plan to clear that strip sometime.  Even 
	in the simplest case, where you will have just one menu strip for 
	the lifetime of your window, you should always clear the menu strip 
	before closing the window.  If you already have a menu strip attached 
	to this window, the correct procedure for changing to a new menu 
	strip involves calling ClearMenuStrip() to clear the old first.  

	The sequence of events should be:
	- OpenWindow()
	- zero or more iterations of:
      	- SetMenuStrip()
      	- ClearMenuStrip()
	- CloseWindow()

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure
	Menu = pointer to the first menu in the menu strip

    RESULT
	TRUE if there were no problems.  TRUE always, since this routine
	will wait until it is OK to proceed.

    FUNCTION
	Changes the number of mouse messages that Intuition will allow
	to be outstanding for your window.

    INPUTS
	Window = your window
	QueueLength = the new value of outstanding mouse movement messages
	  you wish to allow.

    RESULT
	-1 if 'Window' is not known
	Otherwise the previous value of the queue limit.

    NAME
	SetPointer -- Specify a pointer sprite image for a window.

    SYNOPSIS
	SetPointer( Window, Pointer, Height, Width, XOffset, YOffset )
		    A0      A1       D0      D1     D2       D3

	VOID SetPointer( struct Window *, UWORD *, WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	Sets up the window with the sprite definition for the pointer.  
	Then, whenever the window is the active one, the pointer 
	image will change to the window's version.  If the window is
	the active one when this routine is called, the change takes
	place immediately.

	The XOffset and YOffset parameters are used to offset the
	upper-left corner of the hardware sprite image from what Intuition
	regards as the current position of the pointer.  Another way of
	describing it is as the offset from the "hot spot" of the pointer
	to the top-left corner of the sprite.  For instance, if you specify 
	offsets of zero, zero, then the top-left corner of your sprite 
	image will be placed at the mouse position.  On the other hand, 
	if you specify an XOffset of -7 (remember, sprites are 16 pixels 
	wide) then your sprite will be centered over the mouse position.  
	If you specify an XOffset of -15, the right-edge of the sprite 
	will be over the mouse position.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window to receive this pointer definition
	Pointer = pointer to the data definition of a sprite
	Height = the height of the pointer
	Width = the width of the sprite (must be less than or equal to sixteen)
	XOffset = the offset for your sprite from the mouse position
	YOffset = the offset for your sprite from the mouse position

	None

    NAME
	SetPrefs -- Set Intuition preferences data.

    SYNOPSIS
	Prefs = SetPrefs( PrefBuffer, Size, Inform )
	D0		  A0          D0    D1

	struct Preferences *SetPrefs( struct Preferences *, LONG, BOOL );

    FUNCTION
	Sets new preferences values.  Copies the first 'Size' bytes
	from your preferences buffer to the system preferences table,
	and puts them into effect.

	The 'Inform' parameter, if TRUE, indicates that an IDCMP_NEWPREFS
	message is to be sent to all windows that have the IDCMP_NEWPREFS
	IDCMPFlag set.
   
	It is legal to set a partial copy of the Preferences structure.
	The most frequently changed values are grouped at the beginning
	of the Preferences structure.

	New for V36:  A new and more extensible method for supplying
	Preferences has been introduced in V36, and relies on file
	system notification.  The Intuition preferences items rely
	also on the IPrefs program.  Certain elements of the
	Preferences structure have been superseded by this new method.
	(Elements are generally superseded as new hardware or software
	features demand more information than fits in struct Preferences.
	Parts of struct Preferences must be ignored so that applications
	calling GetPrefs(), modifying some other part of struct Preferences,
	then calling SetPrefs(), don't end up truncating the extended
	data).

	Pointer Preferences:  Starting with V36, pointer changes
	submitted through SetPrefs() are only heeded until the first
	time IPrefs informs Intuition of a V36-style pointer preferences
	file.  In V39 and higher, only the pointer from the initial
	SetPrefs() (i.e. devs:system-configuration) is heeded.

	Palette Preferences:  Starting with V39, color changes submitted
	through SetPrefs() are ignored after the first time IPrefs sends
	Intuition new style palette preferences.

	FontHeight and LaceWB:  These are only respected from
	devs:system-configuration.

	View centering and size:  Changes to ViewX/YOffset and
	Row/ColumnSizeChange only apply to the default monitor
	(NTSC or PAL), and not to other monitors such as Productivity.

	Other fields may be superseded in the future.

    INPUTS
	PrefBuffer = pointer to the memory buffer which contains your
	    desired settings for Intuition preferences
	Size = the number of bytes in your PrefBuffer, the number of bytes
           you want copied to the system's internal preference settings
	Inform = whether you want the information of a new preferences
	    setting propagated to all windows.

    NOTES
	Unless you are responding to a user's explicit request to
	change Preferences (for example, you are writing a Preferences
	editor), you should probably avoid using this function.
	The user's Preferences should be respected, not overridden.

    RESULT
	Returns your parameter PrefBuffer.

    NAME
	SetWindowPointerA -- Select a pointer for your window. (V39)
	SetWindowPointer -- Varargs stub for SetWindowPointerA(). (V39)

    SYNOPSIS
	SetWindowPointerA( window, taglist )
	                   A0      A1

	VOID SetWindowPointerA( struct Window *, struct TagItem * );

	SetWindowPointer( window, tag1, ... )

	VOID SetWindowPointer( struct Window *, ULONG tag1, ... );

    FUNCTION
	Allows you to set the pointer image associated with the
	specified window.  Whenever the window is the active one,
	the pointer image will change to the window's version.
	If the window is the active one when this routine is
	called, the change takes place immediately.

    INPUTS
	window = pointer to the window to receive this pointer definition
	taglist = pointer to a taglist describing your pointer

    TAGS
	The same three tags are also accepted by OpenWindowTagList(),
	which allows you to establish the initial pointer at the
	time you open your window.

	WA_Pointer (APTR) - The pointer you wish to associate with
	    your window.  If NULL, you are requesting the Preferences
	    default pointer.  Custom pointers should be allocated
	    by performing a NewObject() on "pointerclass".
	    (See <intuition/pointerclass.h>).  Defaults to NULL.

	WA_BusyPointer (BOOL) - Set to TRUE to request the Preferences
	    busy-pointer.  If FALSE, your pointer will be as requested
	    by WA_Pointer.  Defaults to FALSE.

	WA_PointerDelay (BOOL) - Set to TRUE to defer changing your
	    pointer for a brief instant.  This is typically used
	    along with setting the busy pointer, especially when
	    the application knows it may be busy for a very short
	    while.  If the application clears the pointer or sets
	    another pointer before the delay expires, the pending
	    pointer change is cancelled.  This reduces short
	    flashes of the busy pointer.

    RESULT
	None

    EXAMPLE
	This example sets the standard busy pointer with pointer-delay,
	does a bit of work, then clears the pointer:

		/* Put up the busy pointer, with pointer-delay */
		SetWindowPointer( win,
		    WA_BusyPointer, TRUE,
		    WA_PointerDelay, TRUE,
		    TAG_DONE );

		/* Do busy stuff here */

		/* No tags means "clear the pointer" */
		SetWindowPointer( win,
		    TAG_DONE );

intuition.library/SetWindowTitles           intuition.library/SetWindowTitles

    NAME
	SetWindowTitles -- Set the window's titles for both window and screen.

    SYNOPSIS
	SetWindowTitles( Window, WindowTitle, ScreenTitle )
			 A0      A1           A2

	VOID SetWindowTitles( struct Window *, UBYTE *, UBYTE * );

    FUNCTION
	Allows you to set the text which appears in the Window and/or Screen
	title bars.

	The window title appears at all times along the window title bar.
	The window's screen title appears at the screen title bar whenever
	this window is the active one.
   
	When this routine is called, your window title will be changed 
	immediately.  If your window is the active one when this routine is 
	called, the screen title will be changed immediately.
   
	You can specify a value of -1 (i.e. (UBYTE *) ~0) for either of
	the title pointers.  This designates that you want Intuition to leave
	the current setting of that particular title alone, and modify
	only the other one.  Of course, you could set both to -1.

	Furthermore, you can set a value of 0 (zero) for either of the
	title pointers.  Doing so specifies that you want no title to
	appear (the title bar will be blank).

	Both of the titles are rendered in the default font of the window's
	screen, as set using OpenScreen().

	In setting the window's title, Intuition may do some other rendering
	in the top border of your window.  If your own rendering sometimes
	appears in your window border areas, you may want to restore the entire
	window border frame.  The function SetWindowTitles() does not do this
	in the newer versions.  The function RefreshWindowFrame() is provided
	to do this kind of thing for you.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to your window structure
	WindowTitle = pointer to a null-terminated text string, or set to
           either the value of -1 (negative one) or 0 (zero)
	ScreenTitle = pointer to a null-terminated text string, or set to
           either the value of -1 (negative one) or 0 (zero)

    SYNOPSIS
	ShowTitle( Screen, ShowIt )
		   A0      D0

	VOID ShowTitle( struct Screen *, BOOL );

    FUNCTION
	This routine sets the SHOWTITLE flag of the specified screen, and
	then coordinates the redisplay of the screen and its windows.
	
	The screen title bar can appear either in front of or behind
	WFLG_BACKDROP windows.  This is contrasted with the fact that
	non-WFLG_BACKDROP windows always appear in front of the screen title
	bar.  You specify whether you want the screen title bar to be in front
	of or behind the screen's WFLG_BACKDROP windows by calling this
	routine.

	The ShowIt argument should be set to either TRUE or FALSE.  If TRUE,
       the screen's title bar will be shown in front of WFLG_BACKDROP windows
.
       If FALSE, the title bar will be rendered behind all windows.

       When a screen is first opened, the default setting of the SHOWTITLE
       flag is TRUE.

    INPUTS
       Screen = pointer to a Screen structure
       ShowIt = Boolean TRUE or FALSE describing whether to show or hide the
           screen title bar

    SYNOPSIS
	SizeWindow( Window, DeltaX, DeltaY )
		    A0      D0      D1

	VOID SizeWindow( struct Window *, WORD, WORD );

    FUNCTION
	This routine sends a request to Intuition asking to size the window 
	the specified amounts.  The delta arguments describe how much to 
	size the window along the respective axes.  

	Note that the window will not be sized immediately, but rather 
	will be sized the next time Intuition receives an input event, 
	which happens currently at a minimum rate of ten times per second,
	and a maximum of sixty times a second.  You can discover when 
	you window has finally been sized by setting the IDCMP_NEWSIZE flag
	of the IDCMP of your window.  See the "Input and Output Methods"
	chapter of The Intuition Reference Manual for description of the IDCMP.

	New for V36: Intuition now will do validity checking on the final
	dimensions.  To change to new absolute dimensions, or to move and
	size a window in one step, use ChangeWindowBox().

	However, limit checking against window MinWidth, MinHeight,
	MaxWidth, and MaxHeight was not done prior to V36, and
	these fields are still ignored (as documented) if you have
	no sizing gadget (WFLG_SIZEGADGET is not set).  The *are*
	respected now (V36) if WFLG_SIZEGADGET is set.

	New for V36: you can determine when the change in size has
	taken effect by receiving the IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP message.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the structure of the window to be sized
	DeltaX = signed value describing how much to size the window
	 on the x-axis
	DeltaY = signed value describing how much to size the window
	 on the y-axis

intuition.library/SysReqHandler               intuition.library/SysReqHandler

    NAME
	SysReqHandler -- Handle system requester input. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	num = SysReqHandler( Window, IDCMPFlagsPtr, WaitInput )
	D0                   A0      A1             D0

	LONG SysReqHandler( struct Window *, ULONG *, BOOL );

    FUNCTION
	Handles input for a window returned by either BuildSysRequest()
	or BuildEasyRequest().  These functions with SysReqHandler()
	you can perform an "asynchronous" EasyRequest() or AutoRequest().
	That is to say, you can perform other processing while you
	wait for the requester to be satisfied.

	Each time this function is called, it will process all
	IDCMPMessages that the window has received.  If the parameter
	'WaitInput' is non-zero, SysReqHandler() will wait for input
	(by calling WaitPort()) if there are no IDCMP messages.

	SysReqHandler() returns the same values as EasyRequest(): A gadget
	ID greater than equal to 0, and  -1 if one of the other IDCMP
	events were received.

	An additional value of -2 is returned if the input processed
	does not satisfy the requester.  In this case, you might
	perform some processing and call SysReqHandler() again.

	Note: this function does NOT terminate the system request.
	Not only must you call FreeSysRequest() to eliminate the request,
	but you may also continue processing after an event which would
	normally terminate a normal call to EasyRequest().

    EXAMPLE
	Implementation of EasyRequest() input loop:

	window = BuildEasyRequest( ... )
	while ( (retval = SysReqHandler( window, idcmp_ptr, TRUE )) == -2 )
	{
	    /* loop	*/;
	}
	FreeSysRequest( window );

    EXAMPLE
	Request a volume, but don't remove the requester when the
	user inserts the wrong disk:

	struct EasyStruct volumeES = {
	    sizeof (struct EasyStruct),
	    0,
	    "Volume Request",
	    "Please insert volume %s in any drive.",
	    "Cancel"
	};

	Volume *
	getVolume( volname )
	UBYTE	*volname;
	{
	    struct Window	*window;
	    Volume		*volume = NULL;
	    Volume		*findVolume();
	    int			retval;

	    window = BuildEasyRequest( NULL, &volumeES, IDCMP_DISKINSERTED,
	    	      volname );

	    while ( (retval = SysReqHandler( window, NULL, TRUE )) != 0 )
	    {
	    	/* not cancelled yet	*/

	    	/* when IDCMP_DISKINSERTED, check for volume */
	    	if (( retval == -1 ) && (volume = findVolume( volname )))
		    break;
	    }
	    FreeSysRequest( window );
	    return ( volume );
	}

    INPUTS
	Window = Window pointer returned from BuildSysRequest() or
		BuildEasyRequest().  Those functions can also return
		values '0' or '1', and these values may also be
		passed to SysReqHandler(), which will immediately
		return the same value.

	IDCMPFlagsPtr = If you passed application specific IDCMP
		flags to BuildSysRequest() or BuildEasyRequest(),
		SysReqHandler() will return -1 if that IDCMP message
		is received.  If IDCMPFlagsPtr is non-null, it
		points to a ULONG where the IDCMP class received
		will be copied for your examination.

		This pointer can be NULL if you have provided no
		application specific IDCMP flags or if you do
		not need to know which application specific IDCMP 
		event occurred.

		If you provide more than on flag in the flags variable
		this pointer points to, you will have to refresh
		the variable whenever -1 is returned, since the
		variable will have been changed to show just the
		single IDCMP Class bit that caused the return.

	WaitInput = Specifies that you want SysReqHandler() to
	        to wait for IDCMP input if there is none pending.

    RESULT
	0, 1, ..., N = Successive GadgetID values, for the gadgets
	    you specify for the requester.  NOTE: The numbering
	    from left to right is actually: 1, 2, ..., N, 0.
	    This is for compatibility with AutoRequests which has
	    FALSE for the rightmost gadget.
	    
	-1 = Means that one of the caller-supplied IDCMPFlags occurred.
	    The IDCMPFlag value is in the longword pointed to by UDCMP_ptr.

	-2 = input processed did not satisfy the requester. One example
	    is a keystroke that does not satisfy the requester.  Another
	    example is if there is no input pending and you specified
	    FALSE for WaitInput.

    FUNCTION
	This function is equivalent to DisplayAlert(), except that if
	the user fails to respond in a given time, the alert comes
	down automatically.  See the autodoc for DisplayAlert() for
	full details.

    INPUTS
	AlertNumber = the number of this alert message.  The only pertinent
	    bits of this number are the ALERT_TYPE bit(s).  The rest of the
           number is ignored by this routine.
	String = pointer to the alert message string, as described above
	Height = minimum display lines required for your message
	Time = length of time the alert should wait for the user to
	    respond.  This time is the number of video frames the
	    alert should remain up for.

    RESULT
	A BOOL value of TRUE or FALSE.  If this is a DEADEND_ALERT, FALSE
	is always the return value.  If this is a RECOVERY_ALERT. The return
	value will be TRUE if the user presses the left mouse button in 
	response to your message, and FALSE if the user presses the right hand 
	button is response to your text, or if the alert could not
	be posted.  If the alert times out, the return value will be FALSE.

    NAME
	UnlockIBase -- Surrender an Intuition lock gotten by LockIBase().

    SYNOPSIS
	UnlockIBase( Lock )
		     A0

	VOID UnlockIBase( ULONG );

    FUNCTION
	
	Surrenders lock gotten by LockIBase().

	Calling this function when you do not own the specified lock will
	immediately crash the system.

    INPUTS
	The value returned by LockIBase() should be passed to this function,
	to specify which internal lock is to be freed.

	Note that the parameter is passed in A0, not D0, for historical reasons.

    RESULT
	None

    NAME
	UnlockPubScreen -- Release lock on a public screen. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	UnlockPubScreen( Name, [Screen] )
			 A0    A1

	VOID UnlockPubScreen( UBYTE *, struct Screen * );

    FUNCTION
	Releases lock gotten by LockPubScreen().
	It is best to identify the locked public screen by
	the pointer returned from LockPubScreen().  To do this,
	supply a NULL 'Name' pointer and the screen pointer.

	In rare circumstances where it would be more convenient to pass
	a non-NULL pointer to the public screen name string, the
	'Screen' parameter is ignored.

    INPUTS
	Name = pointer to name of public screen.  If Name is NULL,
	    then argument 'Screen' is used as a direct pointer to
	    a public screen.
	Screen = pointer to a public screen.  Used only if Name
	    is NULL.  This pointer MUST have been returned
	    by LockPubScreen().
	    It is safe to call UnlockPubScreen() with NULL Name
	    and Screen (the function will have no effect).

	struct View *ViewAddress( VOID );

    FUNCTION
	Returns the address of the Intuition View structure.  If you 
	want to use any of the graphics, text, or animation primitives 
	in your window and that primitive requires a pointer to a view,
	this routine will return the address of the view for you.

	D0                          A0

	struct ViewPort *ViewPortAddress( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Returns the address of the viewport associated with the specified
	window.  The viewport is actually the viewport of the screen within
	which the window is displayed.  If you want to use any of the graphics,
	text, or animation primitives in your window and that primitive
	requires a pointer to a viewport, you can use this call.

	This pointer is only valid as long as your window's screen remains
	open, which is ensured by keeping your window open.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the window for which you want the viewport address

    RESULT
	Returns the address of the Intuition ViewPort structure for
	your window's screen .
   
    BUGS
	This routine is unnecessary: you can just use the expression
	&Window->WScreen->ViewPort.

    NAME
	WindowLimits -- Set the minimum and maximum limits of a window.

    SYNOPSIS
	Success = WindowLimits( Window, MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth,
	D0		        A0      D0        D1         D2
	                        MaxHeight )
	                        D3

	BOOL WindowLimits( struct Window *, WORD, WORD, UWORD, UWORD );

    FUNCTION
	Sets the minimum and maximum limits of the window's size.  Until this
	routine is called, the window's size limits are equal to the initial
	values established in the OpenWindow() function.

	After a call to this routine, the Window will be able to be sized
	to any dimensions within the specified limits.
	
	If you don't want to change any one of the dimensions, set the limit
	argument for that dimension to zero.  If any of the limit arguments 
	is equal to zero, that argument is ignored and the initial setting
	of that parameter remains undisturbed.
   
	If any of the arguments is out of range (minimums greater than the
	current size, maximums less than the current size), that limit
	will be ignored, though the others will still take effect if they
	are in range.  If any are out of range, the return value from this
	procedure will be FALSE.  If all arguments are valid, the return
	value will be TRUE.

	If you want your window to be able to become "as large as possible"
	you may put -1 (i.e. ~0) in either or both Max arguments.  But
	please note: screen sizes may vary for several reasons, and you
	must be able to handle any possible size of window you might end
	up with if you use this method.  Note that you can use the function
	LockPubScreen() to find out how big the screen your window will
	appear in is.  You may also refer to the WScreen field in your
	window structure, providing that your window remains open,
	which will ensure that the screen remains open, and thus the
	pointer remains valid.

	If the user is currently sizing this window, the new limits will
	not take effect until after the sizing is completed.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to a Window structure
	MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth, MaxHeight = the new limits for the size
            of this window.  If any of these is set to zero, it will
            be ignored and that setting will be unchanged.

    RESULT
	Returns TRUE if everything was in order.  If any of the parameters was
	out of range (minimums greater than current size, maximums less than
	current size), FALSE is returned and the errant limit request is
	not fulfilled (though the valid ones will be).

	WindowToBack -- Ask Intuition to send a window behind others.

    SYNOPSIS
	WindowToBack( Window )
		      A0

	VOID WindowToBack( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	This routine sends a request to Intuition asking to send the window 
	in back of all other windows in the screen.

	Note that the window will not be depth-arranged immediately, but rather 
	will be arranged the next time Intuition receives an input event, 
	which happens currently at a minimum rate of ten times per second,
	and a maximum of sixty times a second.  

	Remember that WFLG_BACKDROP windows cannot be depth-arranged.

    INPUTS
	Window = pointer to the structure of the window to be sent to the back

    NAME
	ZipWindow -- Change window to "alternate" position and
	             dimensions. (V36)

    SYNOPSIS
	ZipWindow( Window )
		   A0

	VOID ZipWindow( struct Window * );

    FUNCTION
	Changes the position and dimension of a window to the values
	at the last occasion of ZipWindow being called (or invoked
	via the "zoom" gadget).

	Typically this is used to snap between a normal, large, working
	dimension of the window to a smaller, more innocuous position
	and dimension.

	Like MoveWindow(), SizeWindow(), and ChangeWindowBox(), the action of
	this function is deferred to the Intuition input handler.

	More tuning needs to be done to establish initial values for
	the first invocation of this function for a window.  You can
	provide initial values using the OpenWindow() tag item
	WA_Zoom.

	It could also use a new name, but "ZoomWindow" is misleading,
	since "Zoom" normally implies "scale."

	The zoom gadget will appear (in the place of the old "toback"
	gadget) when you open your window if you either specify a
	sizing gadget or use WA_Zoom.

	You can detect that this function has taken effect by receiving
	an IDCMP_CHANGEWINDOW IDCMP message.

    INPUTS
	Window -- window to be changed.

    RESULT
	None

    BUGS
	OpenWindow() assumes that the proper default "other" dimensions
	are "full size."
