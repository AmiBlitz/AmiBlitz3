   NAME
	AbleICR -- Enable/disable ICR interrupts.

   SYNOPSIS
	oldMask = AbleICR( Resource, mask )
	D0                 A6        D0

	WORD AbleICR( struct Library *, WORD );

   FUNCTION
	This function provides a means of enabling and disabling 8520
	CIA interrupt control registers. In addition it returns the
	previous enable mask.

   INPUTS
	mask            A bit mask indicating which interrupts to be
	                    modified. If bit 7 is clear the mask
	                    indicates interrupts to be disabled. If
	                    bit 7 is set, the mask indicates
	                    interrupts to be enabled. Bit positions
	                    are identical to those in 8520 ICR.

   RESULTS
	oldMask         The previous enable mask before the requested
	                    changes. To get the current mask without
	                    making changes, call the function with a
	                    null parameter.

   EXAMPLES
	Get the current mask:
	    mask = AbleICR(0)
	Enable both timer interrupts:
	    AbleICR(0x83)
	Disable serial port interrupt:
	    AbleICR(0x08)

   EXCEPTIONS
	Enabling the mask for a pending interrupt will cause an
	immediate processor interrupt (that is if everything else is
	enabled). You may want to clear the pending interrupts with
	SetICR() prior to enabling them.

   NOTE
	The CIA resources are special in that there is more than one
	of them in the system. Because of this, the C language stubs
	in amiga.lib for the CIA resources require an extra parameter
	to specify which CIA resource to use. The synopsys for the
	amiga.lib stubs is as follows:

	oldMask = AbleICR( Resource, mask )
	D0                 A6        D0

	WORD AbleICR( struct Library *, WORD );

   NAME
	AddICRVector -- attach an interrupt handler to a CIA bit.

   SYNOPSIS
	interrupt = AddICRVector( Resource, iCRBit, interrupt )
	D0                        A6        D0      A1

	struct Interrupt *AddICRVector( struct Library *, WORD,
		struct Interrupt * );

   FUNCTION
	Assign interrupt processing code to a particular interrupt bit
	of the CIA ICR.  If the interrupt bit has already been
	assigned, this function will fail, and return a pointer to the
	owner interrupt.  If it succeeds, a null is returned.

	This function will also enable the CIA interrupt for the given
	ICR bit.

   INPUTS
	iCRBit          Bit number to set (0..4).
	interrupt       Pointer to interrupt structure.

   RESULT
	interrupt       Zero if successful, otherwise returns a
	                    pointer to the current owner interrupt
	                    structure.

   NOTE
	A processor interrupt may be generated immediatly if this call
	is successful.

	In general, it is probably best to only call this function
	while DISABLED so that the resource to which the interrupt
	handler is being attached may be set to a known state before
	the handler is called. You MUST NOT change the state of the
	resource before attaching your handler to it.

	The CIA resources are special in that there is more than one
	of them in the system. Because of this, the C language stubs
	in amiga.lib for the CIA resources require an extra parameter
	to specify which CIA resource to use. The synopsys for the
	amiga.lib stubs is as follows:

	interrupt = AddICRVector( Resource, iCRBit, interrupt )
	D0                        A6        D0      A1

	struct Interrupt *AddICRVector( struct Library *, WORD,
		struct Interrupt *);

	***WARNING***

	Never assume that any of the CIA hardware is free for use.
	Always use the AddICRVector() function to obtain ownership
	of the CIA hardware registers your code will use.

	Note that there are two (2) interval timers per CIA.  If
	your application needs one of the interval timers, you
	can try to obtain any one of the four (4) until AddICRVector()
	succeeds.  If all four interval timers are in-use, your
	application should exit cleanly.

	If you just want ownership of a CIA hardware timer, or register,
	but do not want interrupts generated, use the AddICRVector()
	function to obtain ownership, and use the AbleICR() function
	to turn off (or on) interrupts as needed.

	Note that CIA-B generates level 6 interrupts (which can degrade
	system performance by blocking lower priority interrupts).  As
	usual, interrupt handling code should be optimized for speed.

	Always call RemICRVector() when your code exits to release
	ownership of any CIA hardware obtained with AddICRVector().

   NAME
	RemICRVector -- Detach an interrupt handler from a CIA bit.

   SYNOPSIS
	RemICRVector( Resource, iCRBit, interrupt )
	              A6        D0      A1

	void RemICRVector( struct Library *, WORD, struct Interrupt *);

   FUNCTION
	Disconnect interrupt processing code for a particular
	interrupt bit of the CIA ICR.

	This function will also disable the CIA interrupt for the
	given ICR bit.

   INPUTS
	iCRBit          Bit number to set (0..4).
	interrupt       Pointer to interrupt structure.

   NAME
	SetICR -- Cause, clear, and sample ICR interrupts.

   SYNOPSIS
	oldMask = SetICR( Resource, mask )
	D0                A6        D0

	WORD SetICR( struct Library *, WORD );

   FUNCTION
	This function provides a means of reseting, causing, and
	sampling 8520 CIA interrupt control registers.

   INPUTS
	mask            A bit mask indicating which interrupts to be
	                    effected. If bit 7 is clear the mask
	                    indicates interrupts to be reset.  If bit
	                    7 is set, the mask indicates interrupts to
	                    be caused. Bit positions are identical to
	                    those in 8520 ICR.

   RESULTS
	oldMask         The previous interrupt register status before
	                    making the requested changes.  To sample
	                    current status without making changes,
	                    call the function with a null parameter.

   EXAMPLES
	Get the interrupt mask:
	    mask = SetICR(0)
	Clear serial port interrupt:
	    SetICR(0x08)

   NOTE
	The CIA resources are special in that there is more than one
	of them in the system. Because of this, the C language stubs
	in amiga.lib for the CIA resources require an extra parameter
	to specify which CIA resource to use. The synopsys for the
	amiga.lib stubs is as follows:

	oldMask = SetICR( Resource, mask )
	D0                A6        D0

	WORD SetICR( struct Library *, WORD );

	***WARNING***

	Never read the contents of the CIA interrupt control registers
	directly.  Reading the contents of one of the CIA interrupt
	control registers clears the register.  This can result in
	interrupts being missed by critical operating system code, and
	other applications.

   EXCEPTIONS
	Setting an interrupt bit for an enabled interrupt will cause
	an immediate interrupt.
