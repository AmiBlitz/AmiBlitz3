NAME
	WZ_AllocWindowHandleA -- Creates a new WizardWindowHandle
	WZ_AllocWindowHandle  -- variable arguments version for higher programming languages

SYNOPSIS
	winhandle = WZ_AllocWindowHandleA(
			screen, user_sizeof, surface, tags )
	D0		D0	D1		A0	A1
	
	struct WizardWindowHandle *WZ_AllocWindowHandleA(
		struct Screen *, ULONG, APTR, struct TagItem *);
	
	winhandle = WZ_AllocWindowHandle(
			screen, user_sizeof, surface, firstTag, ... )
	
	struct WizardWindowHandle *WZ_AllocWindowHandle(
		struct Screen *, ULONG, APTR, Tag, ...);
	

FUNCTION
	Allocates the memory for a WizardWindowHandle which will then be
	initialised.

WARNING
	This structure contains private fields used by StormWizard's routines.
	
ARGUMENTS
	screen		- a pointer to the Screen structure of the screen
			  the window should appear on
	user_sizeof	- the size in bytes of a private structure used to
			  hold program-specific data belonging to the window
			  (see WZ_WindowUserStruct()).
	surface		- the value returned by WZ_OpenSurface()
	tags
	  WWH_StackSize, ULONG
	  	Size of the stack used for the layout process (defaults to
	  	8192).
RESULTS
	winhandle - a pointer to a WizardWindowHandle structure or NULL
		    if an error occurred.
	  Window - a pointer to an Intuition Window structure, if the window
	  	    is already open, otherwise NULL.
	  MenuStrip - a pointer to the window's MenuStrip or NULL if the
	  	      window has no menus.
	  DrawInfo - will be initialised when the structure is created.
	  VisualInfo - will be initialised when the structure is created.
	  ScreenTitle - this field should contain the window's screen title
	  		used when WZ_OpenWindowTags() is called to open the
	  		window. When the structure this field will be filled
	  		with "-1". A call to WZ_CreateWindowObj() will set
	  		it to a useful value.
	  Objects - A MinList structure containing BOOPSI objects that are
	  		to be removed when the WizardHandle is released using
	  		intuition.library/DisposeObject(). It is possible to
	  		insert own objects.
	  Rootgadget - a pointer to a Group gadget which places its members
	  	       within the window and initialises them for the layout
	  	       process.
	  	       There is ALWAYS a root gadget when all objects
	  	       belonging to a window were created. The gadget is at
	  	       the same time the start of the gadget list!
	  RootTopGadget
	  RootLeftGadget
	  RootBottomGadget
	  RootRightGadget
	  	These fields are currently unused and should be initialised
	  	to Null.
	  UserStruct - a pointer to a private structure which has been
	  	       initialised with zeros. If the function was called
	  	       with a user_sizeof argument of zero, this pointer
	  	       contains zero and must not be referred as such!
	  	       However you can in this case use the field to keep
	  	       custom values!

	BOOL	WZ_DrawVImage(
			struct WizardVImage *,
			WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD, UWORD, struct RastPort *,
			struct DrawInfo *, Tag, ... );

FUNCTION
	This function draws a vector image using the parameters supplied.
	This makes it possible to realise Turtle-like graphic images.

WARNING
	Parts of the definition of a vector image contain references to
	other vector images. This recursive behaviour uses the stack
	extensively!

ARGUMENTS
	vimage	- a pointer to the WizardVImage structure which is
		  defined as follows:
	  flags
	    WVIF_MinWidth - if the width passed is smaller than the width
	          specified in the WizardVImage structure, the image will
	          normally not be drawn. In such cases this flag forces
	          the width passed to the minimum value specified. The
	          X position will be subtracted by the difference between
	          these two values divided by two.
	    WVIF_MinHeight - Similar to WVIF_MinWidth, but for the height.
		  If this flag is not set and the height is too small,
		  WZ_DrawVImage() will fail.
	    WVIF_AreaInit - this flag is not used as of now.
	    WVIF_Recursion - this flag indicates recursive behaviour of
		  the vector image. At every call the value in
		  VImage->Counter will be decreased by one. If it ever
		  reaches zero, the recursion will be aborted. The flag
		  must only be used if the vector image is used by a
		  single task.
	  Counter - if the WVIF_Recursion flag is set this value specifies
		  the maximum recursion depth. If you wish the image to be
		  called a second time, specify a 2 here.
	  MinWidth - This is the minimum value for the WZ_DrawVImage() call
	  	  if the WVIF_MinWidth flag is specified.
	  MinHeight - This is the minimum value for the WZ_DrawVImage() call
	  	  if the WVIF_MinHeight flag is specified.
	  RelCoords - This pointer allows you to specify co-ordinates relative
	  	  to any position you like. Create a table consisting of UWORD
	  	  pairs with the first entry being the relative X and the
	  	  second entry being the relative Y value. Terminate the table
	  	  with a combination of two zero bytes.
	  	  The first entry in this table is referenced as the base
	  	  position no. 4. Entries may range from 0 to 65535. Predefined
	  	  base positions are:
	  	  0 - upper-left edge
	  	  1 - upper-right edge
	  	  2 - lower-right edge
	  	  3 - lower-left edge
	  	  If you set this pointer to zero, you are limited to these
	  	  three base positions.
	  Images - here you can specify a series of pointers. The pointer used
	  	  will then be determined using the type field. If type is 0,
	  	  the WizardVImage->Images pointer is used directly, otherwise
	  	  one of the following pointers.
	  	  This implies that the length of the structure can NOT be
	  	  determined!
	x	- the X position for the leftmost part of the image
	y	- the Y position for the uppermost part of the image
	w	- the image width
	h	- the image height
	type	- the type of the image to be drawn
	rp	- a pointer to the RastPort structure to be used
	drinfo	- a pointer to a DrawInfo structure if DrawInfo colors are
		  used or text functions are used.
	tags	- the following tags are defined:

	  WVIA_Text (V37), STRPTR
	  	The address of a string terminated with a zero byte or a
	  	carriage return (for text commands)
	  WVIA_TextFont (V37), struct TextFont *
	   	The TextFont structure to be used for text functions.
	   	Defaults to the DrawInfo structure's font.
	  WVIA_TextPlace (V37), ULONG
	  	Describes how the text will be aligned: use one of the
	  	constants WZRDPLACE_LEFT, WZRDPLACE_CENTER, WZRDPLACE_RIGHT
	  	to align the text appropriately. Defaults to WZRDPLACE_CENTER.
	  WVIA_TextPen (V37), UWORD
	  	This tag is not used yet. You currently have to set the
	  	text colour yourself with an appropriate function call.
	  WVIA_TextStyles (V37), ULONG
	  	This tag is not used yet. You currently have to set the
	  	text style yourself with an appropriate function call.
	  WVIA_TextHighlights (V37), ULONG
	  	This tag is not used yet.
	  WVIA_TextImages (V37), BOOL
	  	Set this to TRUE if you wish to enable images with the
	  	dimension of a text output. A value of FALSE disables this
	  	image type. Defaults to TRUE.
	  WVIA_TagImage (V37), struct WizardVImage *
		This tag allows you to specify a variable definition of the
		vector image.
	  WVIA_TagImageCode (V37), UWORD
	  	Specifies the type used for the image specified with the
	  	WVIA_TagImage tag. Defaults to zero.
	  WVIA_ImageCode (V37), UWORD
	  	If you previously specified the type for a fixed reference
	  	to another vector image with "-1" you can specify its real
	  	type here. If in such cases this tag is left off, the image
	  	reference will be ignored. This tag defaults to "-1".
	  WVIA_Color0-7 (V37), UWORD
	  	This tag contains colours which will be selectable using the
	  	WVICMD_TAGCOLOR command. DrawInfo colours will be selectable,
		too.
	  WVIA_TPoint0-7 (V37), struct TPoint
	  	Using this tag you can include calculated positions into
	  	the VImage definition. The default structure used contains
	  	a value of X<<16+Y.
	  WVIA_AreaPtrn (V37), APTR
	  	A pointer to a grid to be used for all following area-fill
	  	commands (WVICMD_RECTFILL). The height is specified directly
	  	at the WVICMD_SETAFPT call.
	  WVIA_TmpRas (V37), struct TmpRas *
	  	Here you need to specify an initialised TmpRas structure
	  	which will be fixed in the RastPort when the WVICMD_AREAINIT
	  	command is issued.
	  WVIA_BitMapWidth (V37), UWORD
	  	The width of the BitMap passed in special tags. Defaults to
	  	zero.
	  WVIA_BitMapHeight (V37), UWORD
	  	The height of the BitMap passed in special tags. Defaults to
	  	zero.
	  WVIA_BitMap0-7 (V37), struct BitMap *
	  	Bitmaps for DrawVImage() calls.
	  WVIA_PureText (V37), BOOL
	  	Set this to TRUE if an underscore character should instruct
	  	the wizard.library to render the following character under-
	  	lined. A value of FALSE will render underscores as normal
	  	characters. Defaults to TRUE.
	
	Commands for VImage definitions:
	--------------------------------
	
	All commands and the memory size used by following arguments are
	of type LONG!
	
	WVICMD_END :
		Identifies the end of a definition.
	WVICMD_COLOR : Pen;
		Sets the Rastport's APen to the following pen which must be
		within the range from 0 to 255 or a WZRD_... colour. DrawInfo
		colors are selectable, too.
	WVICMD_COLOR2 : Pen;
		Sets the Rastport's BPen to the following pen. The same rules
		as for WVICMD_COLOR apply. This tag is rarely used.
	WVICMD_MOVE : BPkt, XOffset, YOffset;
		Moves the graphic cursor to the coordinates XOffset and
		YOffset which are interpreted relative to the specified
		base position.
	WVICMD_DRAW : BPkt, XOffset, YOffset, Mask;
		Draws a line from the current graphic cursor position to
		the specified position. XOffset and YOffset are interpreted
		as under WVICMD_MOVE, Mask specifies the pattern to be used
		for the line. The specified APen will be used.
	WVICMD_RECTFILL : BPkt, XOffset, YOffset;
		Draws a filled rectangle from the current graphic cursor
		position to the specified position. The rectangle is filled
		with the APen colour. For this operation, the graphic cursor needs
		to be positioned on the upper left edge of the rectangle. The
		coordinates passed specify its lower right edge.
	WVICMD_WRITEPIXEL : BPkt, XOffset, YOffset;
		Draws a single coloured pixel at the coordinates indicated by
		XOffset and YOffset (once again, relative to the base position).
		APen is used for the colour.
	WVICMD_IMAGE : BPKT, XOffset, YOffset, Type , VImage;
		Performs a recursive VImage call. The upper left edge must have
		been previously specified using the WVICMD_MOVE command. The
		lower right edge is specified by XOffset and YOffset as well as
		BPkt. Type specifies the type to be used, a "-1" indicates that
		the type should be taken from the WVIA_ImageCode tag.
		VImage is a pointer to the vector image to be drawn.
	WVICMD_TEXT :
		Renders the text specified with the WVIA_Text tag at the
		current position with the current style and colour.
	WVICMD_SETDRMD :
		Sets the RastPort's DrawMode. It defaults to RP_JAM1.
	WVICMD_TEXTIMAGE : HBorder, VBorder, Type,VImage;
		If a text is drawn, it has a certain position and certain
		dimensions. If you use this command these values are used to
		display an image, however its dimensions will be increased by
		the HBorder and VBorder values. The image will be displayed
		using the specified type and image.
		This type of images can be disabled for the current vector
		image using the WVIA_TextImages tag.
	WVICMD_TEXTMOVE : FontSizeFak, BaseFak, LengthFak,XOffset,YOffset;
		This command moves the cursor relative to the current position.
		The length of the maximum possible text output will be divided by
		LengthFak and added to the current X-position. TextFont->Baseline
		will be divided by BasekFak and added to the current Y-position.
		The font height is divided by FontSizeFak and added to the X
		position as well. You can specify a zero for any argument to
		disable it.
	WVICMD_TAGCOLOR : Col;
		Col specifies the WVIA_Color tag whose colour is to be set. To set
		WVIA_Color1's colour Col must be a '1'.
	WVICMD_TEXTPLACE: BPKT, XOffset, YOffset;
		This command allows you to comfortably position vertically
		centred text within a virtual rectangle. Using the WVIA_Textplace
		tag the text can be placed left-bound, right-bound and centred.
		The rectangle 's upper left edge is taken from the cursor's current
		position whereas the lower-right position must be specified using
		the XOffset and YOffset parameters which are interpreted relative
		to BPKT. Nothing will be written into the RastPort!
	WVICMD_SETAFPT : AreaPtSz, AreaPtrn;
		This command allows you to use arbitrary patterns for fill commands.
		If AreaPtrn is passed with a value of -1L, the WVIA_AreaPtrn tag
		must contain the correct raster address. The raster dimension is
		calculated using the formula 2^AreaPtSz.
	WVICMD_SNAPCURSOR : BPkt;
		Writes the cursor's current X/Y positions back to the specified base
		position. Possible values range from 0 to 15.
	WVICMD_SNAPX : BPkt;
		Writes the cursor's current X position back to the specified base
		position.
	WVICMD_SNAPY : BPkt;
		Writes the cursor's current Y position back to the specified base
		position.
	WVICMD_TAGMOVE : TPoint;
		Sets the cursor to a position specified by a WVIA_TPoint tag. TPoint
		determines the number of the tag to be used.
	WVICMD_TAGIMAGE :  BPKT, XOffset, YOffset, Type, VImageTags;
		Refer to WVICMD_IMAGE how position and dimension are calculated.
		The image address is taken from the WVIA_TagImage tag. VImageTags
		contains the tags for the WZ_DrawVImage() call. If this value is
		-1L the current tags are used. The type for the function call is
		referenced from the WVIA_TagImageCode tag.
	WVICMD_BITMAP_TO_RP : BPKT, XOffset, YOffset, Map;
		This command allows you to blit Bitmaps into the RastPort. BPkt,
		XOffset and YOffset form the upper-left edge. Map must contain the
		number of the WVIA_BitMap tag. The Bitmap's proportions must be
		specified using the WVIA_BitMapWidth and WVIA_BitMapHeight tags.
	WVICMD_FILLBORDER : BPKT, XOffset, YOffset, HBorder, VBorder;
		This command draws a border using the current APen. The function
		draws from the upper-left edge of the vector image to its
		lower-right edge. The area from the current cursor position to
		the specified base position will not be touched. Base position
		(BPkt), XOffset and YOffset specify the lower-right edge whose
		contents will NOT be overdrawn.
		Using HBorder and VBorder you can reduce the vector image's
		dimensions within the routine.
	WVICMD_Beep :
		calls intuition.library's DisplayBeep() with a Screen value of
		zero.
	WVICMD_AREAINIT :
		Initializes the RastPort for usage of area functions. The
		WVIA_TmpRas tag must contain a pointer to an initialized TmpRas
		structure.
	WVICMD_AREAMOVE : BPKT, XOffset, YOffset;
		Moves the cursor for area functions to the position specified by
		XOffset and YOffset which are interpreted relative to the base
		position BPkt. This command can be followed by up to three calls
		to the WVICMD_AREADRAW command.
	WVICMD_AREADRAW : BPKT, XOffset, YOffset;
		Draws a border line to the specified position (XOffset and YOffset,
		interpreted relative to BPkt). Do not use this command more than
		three times!
	WVICMD_AREAEND :
		Draws a filled image into the RastPort. The current APen and the
		current raster image will be used. After this command you can use
		WVICMD_AREAMOVE and WVIA_AREADRAW again.
		
RESULTS
	success	- will always be TRUE.

			  have been changed this value is TRUE. Otherwise
			  it is FALSE.
	winhaddress	- if success is equal to TRUE you will here find a
			  pointer to a WizardWindowHandle which is
			  located under the mouse pointer.
	iaddress	- if success is equal to TRUE you will here find a
			  pointer to the object which is located under the
			  mouse pointer. The pointer must then be used

NAME
	WZ_OpenSurfaceA -- opens a surface description
	WZ_OpenSurface  -- variable arguments version for higher programming languages
	
SYNOPSIS
	Surface	= WZ_OpenSurfaceA(name, memaddr,tags)
	D0		A0	A1	A2
	
	APTR WZ_OpenSurfaceA(STRPTR, APTR,struct TagItem *);

	Surface	= WZ_OpenSurface(name, memaddr,firsttag, ... )
	
	APTR WZ_OpenSurface(STRPTR, APTR,Tag, ... );

FUNCTION
	This function opens a surface description for usage. If the file
	was already loaded you can pass 0 for name and specify its address
	as "memadr".
	Usually, "name" should be a pointer to the name of the file and
	"memadr" should be NULL.

WARNING
	If in address is passed using memadr you have to make sure that the
	surface description will only be initialised once. This means that
	programs which use this capability must not be loaded resident!

ARGUMENTS
	name 	- a pointer to the name of the file (NULL-terminated)
	memaddr - if "name" was not specified: a pointer into the memory
		  location which contains the surface description
	tags 	- the following tags are defined:
		
	  SFH_Locale - (V37) , struct Locale *
		a pointer as returned by locale.library/OpenLocale() if you
		do not want to use the system's standard locale.
	  SFH_Catalog - (V37), struct Catalog *
		a pointer to the opened Catalogue file, see locale.library/
		OpenCatalog().
	  SFH_AutoInit - (V37), BOOL
		If the surface description is to be opened from a fixed
		memory location, setting this to FALSE will disable its
		initialisation. In that case the surface description MUST
		have been already initialised! Defaults to TRUE. 

RESULTS
	Surface	- a pointer or NULL if an error occurred

NAME
	WZ_OpenWindowA -- Opens a window
	WZ_OpenWindow  -- variable arguments version for higher programming languages
	
SYNOPSIS
	window	= WZ_OpenWindowA(winhandle, newwin, tags)
	D0			A0	A1	A2
	
	struct Window *WZ_OpenWindowA(struct WizardWindowHandle *,
			struct NewWindow *, struct TagItem *);

	window	= WZ_OpenWindow(winhandle, newwin, firstTag, ... )
	
	struct Window *WZ_OpenWindow(struct WizardWindowHandle *,
			struct NewWindow *, Tag, ... );

FUNCTION
	Opens a window similar to the Intuition function.

WARNING
	Using the Intuition function will lead to unpredictable results
	during the layout process.

ARGUMENTS
	winhandle	- a WizardWindowHandle as obtained by a call to
			  WZ_AllocWindowHandle()
	newwin		- a NewWindowStruct or NULL, e.g. as returned by
			  WZ_CreateWindowObj().
	tags 		- Tags (e.g. WA_AutoAdjust)

RESULTS
	window		- a pointer to a Window structure or NULL if an
			  error occurred

NAME
	WZ_SnapShotA -- Fixes window positions and dimensions
	WZ_SnapShot -- variable arguments version for higher programming languages
	
SYNOPSIS
	success	= WZ_SnapShotA(surface,tags)
	D0		A0
	
	BOOL	WZ_SnapShot(APTR,struct TagItem *);

	success	= WZ_SnapShot(surface, firstTag, ... )
	D0		A0
	
	BOOL	WZ_SnapShot(APTR, Tag, ... );

FUNCTION
	This function saves the current window position and dimensions back
	to the surface description. Windows which are yet open are ignored.
	Usually you will want to call this function at the end of the
	program.

WARNING
	If WZ_OpenSurface() was called with the "memadr" parameter this
	function will fail!

ARGUMENTS
	surface	- the value returned by a call to WZ_OpenSurface()
	tags - currently none

RESULTS
	success	- TRUE on success or FALSE if an error occured

NAME
	WZ_UnlockWindow -- Unlocks a window
	
SYNOPSIS
	RESULTS = WZ_UnlockWindow(winhandle)
	D0		A0
	
	ULONG	WZ_UnlockWindow(struct WizardWindowHandle *);

FUNCTION
	Reallows user input in a window.

WARNING
	If the window was not previously locked fatal system errors may occur.
	If it was locked multiple times it must be unlocked exactly that often.
	This means that a single call does not necessarily actually reenable
	user input.

ARGUMENTS
	winhandle	- WizardWindowHandle whose window is to be unlocked

RESULTS
	RESULTS	- returns the number of WZ_UnlockWindow() calls left that are
			  required to enable user input. NULL if the window receives user
			  input again. A value of -1 indicates a fatal error.
