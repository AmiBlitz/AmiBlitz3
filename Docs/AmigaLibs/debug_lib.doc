   NAME
	KCmpStr - compare two null terminated strings

   SYNOPSIS
	mismatch = KCmpStr(string1, string2)
	D0         A0        A1

   FUNCTION
	string1 is compared to string2 using the ASCII coalating
	sequence.  0 indicates the strings are identical.
debug.lib/KGetChar                                         debug.lib/KGetChar

   NAME
	KGetChar - get a character from the console
		   (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)

   SYNOPSIS
	char = KGetChar()
	D0

   FUNCTION
	busy wait until a character arrives from the console.
	KGetChar is the assembly interface, _KGetChar and _kgetc
	are the C interfaces.
debug.lib/KGetNum                                           debug.lib/KGetNum

   NAME
	KGetNum - get a number from the console

   SYNOPSIS
	number = KGetNum()
	D0

   FUNCTION
	get a signed decimal integer from the console.  This will busy
	wait until the number arrives.

debug.lib/KMayGetChar                                   debug.lib/KMayGetChar

   NAME
	KMayGetChar - return a character if present, but don't wait
		      (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)

   SYNOPSIS
	flagChar = KMayGetChar()
	D0

   FUNCTION
	return either a -1, saying that there is no character present, or
	whatever character was waiting.  KMayGetChar is the assembly
	interface,  _KMayGetChar is the C interface.
debug.lib/KPrintF                                           debug.lib/KPrintF

   NAME
	KPrintF - print formatted data to the console
	          (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)

   SYNOPSIS
	KPrintF("format string",values)
	         A0             A1

   FUNCTION
	print a formatted C-type string to the console.  See the
	exec RawDoFmt() call for the supported % formatting commands.

   INPUTS
	"format string" - A C style string with % commands to indicate
	                  where paramters are to be inserted.
	values - A pointer to an array of paramters, to be inserted into
	         specified places in the string.

	KPutFmt and KPrintF are identical assembly interfaces that want the
	two pointers in registers.  _KPrintF and _kprintf are C interfaces
	that expect the format string pointer on the stack, and the
	paramters on the stack above that.

   SEE ALSO
	exec.library/RawDoFmt, any C compiler's "printf" call.
debug.lib/KPutChar                                         debug.lib/KPutChar

   NAME
	KPutChar - put a character to the console
		   (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)

   SYNOPSIS
	char = KPutChar(char)
	D0	        D0

   FUNCTION
	Put a character to the console.  This function will not return
	until the character has been completely transmitted.

   INPUTS
	KPutChar is the assembly interface, the character must be in D0.
	_KPutChar and _kputc are the C interfaces, the character must be
	a longword on the stack.

debug.lib/KPutStr                                           debug.lib/KPutStr

   NAME
	KPutStr - put a string to the console
		   (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud)

   SYNOPSIS
	KPutStr(string)
	        A0

   FUNCTION
	put a null terminated string to the console.  This function will
	not return until the string has been completely transmitted.

   INPUTS
	KPutStr is the assembly interface, a string pointer must be in A0.
	_KPutStr and _kputs are the C interfaces, the string pointer must
	be on the stack.
