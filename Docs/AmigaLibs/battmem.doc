   NAME
	ObtainBattSemaphore -- Obtain access to nonvolatile ram. (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	ObtainBattSemaphore( )

	void ObtainBattSemaphore( void );

   FUNCTION
	Aquires exclusive access to the system nonvolatile ram.

   NAME
	ReadBattMem -- Read a bitstring from nonvolatile ram.  (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	Error = ReadBattMem( Buffer, Offset, Len )
	D0                   A0      D0      D1

	ULONG ReadBattMem( APTR, ULONG, ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	Read a bitstring from nonvolatile ram.

   INPUTS
	Buffer          Where to put the bitstring.
	Offset          Bit offset of first bit to read.
	Len             Length of bitstring to read.

   RESULTS
	Error           Zero if no error.

   NOTES
	The battery-backed memory is checksummed. If a checksum error
	is detected, all bits in the battery-backed memory are
	silently set to zero.

	Bits in the battery-backed memory that do not exist are read
	as zero.

	Partial byte reads (less than 8 bits) result in the bits read
	being put in the low-order bits of the destination byte.

   NAME
	ReleaseBattSemaphore -- Allow nonvolatile ram to others.  (V36)

   SYNOPSIS

   NAME
	WriteBattMem -- Write a bitstring to nonvolatile ram.  (V36)

   SYNOPSIS
	Error = WriteBattMem( Buffer, Offset, Len )
	D0                    A0      D0      D1

	ULONG WriteBattMem( APTR, ULONG, ULONG );

   FUNCTION
	Write a bitstring to the nonvolatile ram.

   INPUTS
	Buffer          Where to get the bitstring.
	Offset          Bit offset of first bit to write.
	Len             Length of bitstring to write.

   RESULTS
	Error           Zero if no error.

   NOTES
	The battery-backed memory is checksummed. If a checksum error
	is detected, all bits in the battery-backed memory are
	silently set to zero.

	Partial byte writes (less than 8 bits) result in the bits
	written being read from the low-order bits of the source byte.
