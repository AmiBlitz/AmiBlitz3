Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleHTML allows you to view HTML Files offline. It supports
a little subset of the HTML Tags.

Copyright, Distribtion and Disclamer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleHTML is ©1998-2001 by Sebastian Bauer.
SimpleHTML is freeware. Feel free to spreat it, as long as
all files are included and in an unchanged form. You are not
allowed to make profit from its distribution!
In no way the author can be made responible for any damage created
by the program. Use it at your own risk!

How to use SimpleHTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleHTML can be started from Shell and from Workbench.
The Shell template looks like this:
  FILE,PUBSCREEN/K,WINDOWX/N,WINDOWY/N,WINDOWWIDTH/N,WINDOWHEIGHT/N
FILE specifies the file, which will be viewed after start.
PUBSCREEN specifies the public screen, where the window is opened.
WINDOWX specifies the left edge of the window
WINDOWY specifies the top edge of the window
WINDOWWIDTH specifies the width of the window
WINDOWHEIGHT specifies the height of the window

When starting from WB the file can be specified via a shift double click.
When no filename is given a asl filerequester appears.
Simliar to common Webbrowsers you can specify the file also in
   the file:///<path> and file://localhost/<path>
