short: A replacement for the viewer AmigaGuide
type: util/sys
author: Thomas Igracki
version: 1.0
uploader: T.Igracki@Bamp.berlinet.de

This is a viewer for AmigaGuide files.
The advantage against (sp?) AmigaGuide or MultiView is that ViewGuide
converts a relative path to the absolute path.
This solves the problem of MultiView that if you do this:
"MultiView help/deutsch/PIEd.guide" AmigaGuide couldn't find any node;-(
