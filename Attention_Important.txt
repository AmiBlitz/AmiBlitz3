Attention Important
-------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!Warning!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All Programs created with Amiblitz3 use FPU commands, it doesn't matter with
optimize level are used!
This mean that the program will crash on a System without a FPU sooner or later!


There is a tokeniser fail if you use '#' and a command like 'SizeOf.' for
example 'MOVE.l #SizeOf.EasyStruct,es_StructSize' this will treated by the
compiler then as a constant with the name '#SizeOf.EasyStruct'.

As a workaround you have to put a Space in between for the example
      'MOVE.l # SizeOf.EasyStruct,es_StructSize'
that the compiler generate the right code!

!!!Warning!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!

DefLibs-file changed, NULL Token copied old one renamed to GetGlobalStrAddr to
made it working also changed the Compiler to only overwrite new Null Token!

!!! A update of the Instruction index is needed if you only copy over the !!!
!!! updated files!!!


All Sourcefiles are now converted to .ab3 files.

If you have "Include" this files in you Sourcecodes then please
change the name form ".bb2"or ".ab2" to ".ab3" to avoid conflicts!


If you copy new Version of the IDE over older Versions then you
have to "DELETE" all files in the formats ".bb", ".bb2" and ".ab2"
and the ".xtra" files that are not privat!

Here a list of the directories:
