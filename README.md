What we have got here is the complete package of AmiBlitz3 - a BASIC-compiler for 68k-amiga.

## Requirements are:
- Kickstart 2.04
- 68020 (not tested below)
- 10megs of RAM to do things
- FPU ... but only when building FPU-optimized executables :-)

## Installation:
To get started with AB3, just download the repository and extract it somewhere on your harddisk.
You may copy the OS-libraries in Libs-Drawer to system's "Libs"-drawer before starting, otherwise the IDE will complain about mission OS-libraries.

## What this package contains:
Everything you need as of:
- Full IDE with needed OS-libraries
- localization for english, german and french available
- lots of documentations accessable from IDE (check "Help"-Menu)
- lots of usefull includes written in AB3 itself (with its own documentation)
- every include file has its own short demo in it, just compile and run them!
- some examples to demonstrate various features
