What we have got here is the complete package of AmiBlitz3 - a BASIC-compiler for 68k-amiga.

## Requirements for IDE are:
- 35 MB of harddisc space
- 8 MB RAM to do little things, _12 MB RAM to do serious development_
- 68020 processor
- Workbench 2.1 (V38), or Workbench 2.04 (V37) with locale.library
- wizard.library (included)

These requirements apply for the IDE only, not for the compiled output.

## Installation:
To get started with AB3, just download the [current release](https://github.com/AmiBlitz/AmiBlitz3/releases/latest) and extract it somewhere on your harddisk.
You may copy the OS-libraries in Libs-Drawer to system's "Libs"-drawer before starting, otherwise the IDE will complain about missing OS-libraries.

## What this package contains:
Everything you need as of:
- full IDE with all needed OS-libraries
- localization for english, german, french and italian
- lots of documentation directly accessable by the IDE (check "Help"-Menu)
- lots of usefull includes written in AB3 itself (with its own documentation)
- every include file has its own short demo in it, just compile and run them!
- some examples to demonstrate various features
