# AmiBlitz3
What we have got here is the complete package of AmiBlitz3 - a BASIC-compiler for 68k-amiga.

## Requirements for IDE are:
- 35 MB of harddisc space
- 8 MB RAM to do things, _12 MB RAM to do serious development_
- MC 68020 processor
- Workbench 2.1 (or, Workbench 2.04 with locale.library)

## Installation:
To get started with AB3, just download the [current release](https://github.com/AmiBlitz/AmiBlitz3/releases/tag/v3.8.0) and extract it somewhere on your harddisk.
You may copy the OS-libraries in Libs-Drawer to system's "Libs"-drawer before starting, otherwise the IDE will complain about mission OS-libraries.

## What this package contains:
Everything you need as of:
- Full IDE with needed OS-libraries
- localization for english, german, french and italian 
- lots of documentations directly accessable by the IDE (check "Help"-Menu)
- lots of usefull includes written in AB3 itself (with its own documentation)
- every include file has its own short demo in it, just compile and run them!
- some examples to demonstrate various features
